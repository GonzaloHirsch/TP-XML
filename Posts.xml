So you could not, for example, group all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4th&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;4th&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;4th&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/15th&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;15th&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;15th&lt;/a&gt; century tags under an umbrella &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/middle-ages&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;middle-ages&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;middle-ages&lt;/a&gt; without sacrificing the ability to individually use the sub-tags for each century. You also could not create a correlation between &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww2&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ww2&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ww2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/20th-century&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;20th-century&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;20th-century&lt;/a&gt; mechanically unless you were trying to say they were equivalent. You would have to keep the tags separate in order to properly use them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lack of mechanical assistance to this endeavor also leads me to have low expectations on the success of such double-tagging in practice when the site is opened up. You are likely to have users who will only use the event tag, rather than the period/century tag, which would require a lot of upkeep on the community to maintain proper tagging. Without constant vigilance and maintenance, it will quickly result that questions with the event tags will not always have the corresponding period/century tag, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternate option that is available is to provide custom tag sets through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;http://stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;tagged questions&lt;/code&gt; section. You can create a tag filter that would select, say, all of the events pertinent to a particular period or century. So for example, you would include &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww1&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ww1&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ww1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww2&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ww2&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ww2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cold-war&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cold-war&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cold-war&lt;/a&gt; (I know there's more to history than wars, but those were 3 easy picks) under the &quot;20th century&quot; tag filter, and similar filters for other centuries. You could also group events or centuries with particular periods like the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tag filters can then be subscribed to, by email or by RSS feed, to allow for monitoring in a similar fashion as with favorite tags.

Books are stubbon things. They give up their knowledge when you pull them from the shelf and pry them open, they require you to be in the same geographical location and they fail to be indexed by Googlebots. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past few days I have dug some interesting pieces of information from my personal library and added it to the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/26/what-led-to-the-first-fight-in-the-american-civil-war/69#69&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;, Lincoln's inaugural address existed on the Internet, but without this particular context in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before this question, the Internet's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com.au/search?gcx=c&amp;amp;ix=c1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=When%20and%20Why%20was%20the%20samurai%20class%20abolished&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to '&lt;em&gt;When and Why was the samurai class abolished&lt;/em&gt;' talks about the fact with little concern for the reasons. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/120/when-and-why-was-the-samurai-class-abolished/162#162&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; makes the connection to to the Meiji Restoration's Charter Oath, which previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Oath&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;existed&lt;/a&gt; on the Internet without that context (and with a different translation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are examples of knowledge and context that was previously hidden away in books and now exist online and we have more &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/12/who-if-any-in-jfks-inner-circle-argued-against-the-plans-for-the-bay-of-pigs&quot;&gt;work to do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we, potentially, re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was ready to rant that we need to be more aggressive about closing questions that can be answered trivially on Wikipedia, but looking at the home page this morning, I don't see any questions like that.

Seriously, I haven't asked a single question so far - yet I learned lots of things about history that I didn't know before. It was mostly details that history books didn't consider important enough. Yet these details help you truly understand an epoch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why should it exist?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO the best answers on this site are the ones that show the large picture and put well-known events into a far less known context. Sure, each single fact is usually already available online. But finding the connection between them and explaining how it all fits together - that's something that even many history books fail on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, we all know that machine guns and similar technical advances made &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/230/when-was-the-last-cavalry-charge&quot;&gt;cavalry attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/308/when-were-swords-last-used-in-european-warfare&quot;&gt;cold weapons&lt;/a&gt; useless in modern warfare. But it couldn't have happened overnight. So when did this change actually happen? How long did various armies hold onto them and why? Now we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions are &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/71/why-did-hitler-attack-the-soviet-union-when-he-was-still-busy-fighting-britain&quot;&gt;far too complicated to be researched in full here&lt;/a&gt;. Still, bringing together the different points of view and discussing them does create value because everywhere else you get one point of view and no alternatives. Oh, and I changed my opinion into the exact opposite after researching that question - oops...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes we seem to dig up something that is genuinely new. Up until now if you asked which Confederate state contributed the most soldiers to the army you were bound to end up with North Carolina. &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/169/which-confederate-state-provided-the-most-troops-in-the-american-civil-war/394#394&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; we don't only have the correct answer and an explanation as to why the numbers are unreliable, but also the most likely source of the North Carolina theory - some facts have been put together than only existed separately before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think that it is a problem of scope. Some questions are simply already well-researched, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/365/first-recorded-use-of-aerial-weapons-in-warfare&quot;&gt;history of flight&lt;/a&gt;.

Dig a bit further and you will find content that gets close to answering question, but in horrible &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onwar.com/articles/9901.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;pre-StackExchange type sites&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn't Imperial Japan attack the Soviet Union during World War 2?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the first result:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Warning: array_merge() [function.array-merge]: Argument #1 is not an array in [path]/archive/global.php(40) : eval()'d code on line 118&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Followed by an adsense block and then some forum results.

I see this on some answers, but then again I see other answers where people make assertions and don't properly back any of them up. Since I almost always wasn't there in the time/place the answerer is talking about, I have no basis to know whether or not what they say is true.

As a moderator on another SE site, I saw someone answering questions that often mentioned the product he writes and sells. At first I was like &quot;ugh, this guy is peddling his product&quot; but after reading a post or two, I realized he was a very smart man who had researched his topic very, very thoroughly and was able to use his experience to help solve peoples problems. Then at the end he kindly put &quot;I solved this problem, and a few more, with my tool -yada yada-&quot;. If I would have dismissed his original research right then, three or four people that week would have had a tougher time with serious problems they were facing at work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is uniquely different than Skeptics. To the best of my knowledge (and I stand to be corrected) &lt;strong&gt;there are no professional degrees, certifications, or other recognitions in ConspiracyTheoryOlogy&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. While there are certainly plenty who devote their life to analyzing conspiracy theories (images of guys with huge bushy beards living in trailers in the mountains or underground bunkers come to mind) none of them are accredited by a university or professional trade organization or anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should take any original research from a non-professional with a grain of salt as amateur. This is not to say completely dismiss it, but to keep in mind that it did indeed come from an amateur. On Skeptics, due to the lack of any non-amateur by definition, it is very easy to say &quot;This will get out of hand, so we will require sources in all instances.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, we should also point out that Wikipedia does allow for research published elsewhere (journals, websites, etc) to edit the content to include as long as it's done so fairly. This fairness is enforced by the community who constantly review each page (which if you actually look, even the 'forgotten' pages have a fairly recent last update date!!) I imagine if someone on the Skeptics site had published an article in a professional and recognized science journal that they would be able to cite it, and perhaps even include other evidence not published there, based on their obvious professional and expert status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, with the number of professionals we have (and certainly hope to have) we should keep original research on a long leash. That is to say, not unbounded. There should be an expectation that original research is either called out (on SO and other sites, I often put [citation needed] in the comments, especially when someone's like &quot;Java is slow, use assembly, man!&quot; or some other unfounded claim) or backed up by professional credentials. I would not be comfortable with someone being both professional and anonymous. If you want me to trust your original, unpublished research on THIS topic, I want to see your original &lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt; research on other topics. In other words, I want to see credible evidence of your ability to perform meaningful research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, laying down guidelines of what is and isn't allowed for original research will help us remain objective. If someone crosses what we define as the guidelines, we can gently point them here (and ideally this would belong in the FAQ, which we know all members of online communities read before they post, right?

The century tags give you exact periods. World War 2 happened at a very specific time. The Middle Ages, while disputed on the exact length at times, are still a very specific period of time that is defined as being that time. These all work as tags because when someone looks at that period, they know when it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The existence of this question is evidence to the contrary when it comes to periods where their definition is &lt;em&gt;relative to the current period&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ancient-history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ancient-history&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ancient-history&lt;/a&gt; is actually more problematic because of its nebulous nature - when does ancient start?

Early modern extends how far back? In a few years, does it still count as early modern, will we have to &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; tags?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags are not meant to be dynamically changing - they're intended to be a static descriptor that helps you strongly identify what a question is about. If a tag's validity is affected by the passage of time because it is relative to present day, then it is extremely suspect as a tag. This kind of effect is a bit more visible on other sites like Gaming, where we have &quot;old-games&quot; and &quot;retro-games&quot; tags that just no one is sure what counts as that because of how fast the game generations span out.

But I couldn't find that question anywhere. The closest question was &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/897/why-study-our-countrys-history&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which was closed because of its argumentative nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is the problem with this question - I think it can be very argumentative. But it is also fundamental to the field of history. I am new to this SE; I spend most of my time at MathSE or PhilSE. At MathSE, this type of question would (and has) survive if formulated properly. At PhilSE, it would not (I think). I think this is due to the continued use and support of use of Community Wiki (CW) for questions that are of questionable content, despite the general trend at SO to phase CW out. This, in turn, I attribute to the fact that MathSE has an incredibly large and active user base, so a few questions can be tossed in even if they do not fit perfectly within the SOP of the SE model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I find the idea of asking a question about 'why studying history is useful' due to my background as a mathematician. As a mathematician, people often ask me why we bother studying math to the extent that we do (e.g. what do we ever do with geometry? Who really uses calculus, and why should high schoolers learn it? And so on...), and I answer it all the time. I suspect that historians can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how should I formulate a question, addressing the importance of studying history, so that it will be acceptable on this SE?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="474" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:47:51.627" LastActivityDate="2012-02-01T21:29:32.593" Title="Potential, but problematic, question" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="5" />

Furthermore, the resulting debate would be unfocused as where with a specific hypothesis, a more productive and interesting debate would follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is obvious from the long list of questions asked in the post linked to by the asker are not so much historical questions as they are questions on specific military tactics of that particular age.  While there is a historical component to these tactics, many of these questions lack clear answers to the larger question asked (ie. &quot;could the axis powers have won if X?&quot;) and will virtually always lack clear answers.  This is because there is a myriad of potential variables which could intervene that go well beyond any particular tactical or even strategic decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even in the context of a specific military engagement there is always the countering question of what other actors would have done in response, which is often difficult to answer.  Even if a logical outcome can be determined based on a specific tactic, it then becomes necessary to explain how this would effect the larger environment and in such a fashion more and more speculation is required.

I was wondering what we could do to improve the site's performance.  Here are some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We seem to be suffering from a lack of experts.  It seems like we should reach out to people who have an academic background in history.  It's good that we are getting quite a few people, like myself, who have an active interest in history, but no academic credentials, but it would certainly be good to have people who have devoted their careers to the study.  I don't know if this has been considered, but maybe we should reach out to the various history departments throughout the world?  It would be really nifty if professors asked questions here for their students to participate in.  This seems like a good example of us being able to use the &quot;technical-fetishism&quot; displayed by many academic institutions to our benefit.  Also, I'd imagine that many professors would have an inclination to help us advance the spread of historical interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we lack experts, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/204/742&quot;&gt;Hauser notes in TED's thread&lt;/a&gt;, we also lack diversity in interest.  Again this could be improved by reaching out to institutions or various groups that have an interest in a specific historical field.  It would be nice if we could implement specialty into the site's mechanics, possibly by letting users select one or two historical fields to specialize in (or automatically selecting a specialty for users based on the tags of questions they answered, possibly modified by the reputation attached to each answer).  We could also have incentives for having uncommon specialties such as providing badges or incentive bonuses for a certain amount of posts for uncommon tags.             &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this has been considered or if it's necessarily a good idea, but maybe offering users similar incentives as the above mentioned point for directing users to the site?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway just some things to consider.

It would be good to get more questions here, and I am making it a goal to add more on topics I have been looking into, and to me that is part of it, participation.

Previously SE did have a contest to get more questions to the site but that didn't really garner much, but I think WWI might have been a difficult choice, at least for me - but then it also falls into the area of Military History that Sigue mentioned.  My concentrations were on Colonial American and Chinese-Japanese history so there are many questions I wouldn't feel qualified to answer without study, it'd be nice to know who focuses on what area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not know about many experts that we might get, strangely many of my history professors in college I have seen recently were still not really using technology much in the classroom or their personal lives.

I've been withholding because I'm not sure &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to vote. An up vote can express a few different things, such as “insightful!”, “well-written!”, “funny!”, “made me think!” or “well-researched!”. I see there's been some discussion about whether answers should provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/should-we-include-sources-in-answers&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99/our-answers-need-to-be-more-like-skeptic-ses-answers&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt;, and personally I think on a site dealing with history they really should.

This puts me in a dilemma when seeing the many answers on this site that do seem “insightful” or “well-written” but which do not seem particularly “well-researched” because they don't provide any references. Should I up-vote anyway or withhold completely? It makes me wish I could do something like cast a half vote to incentivize the answerer to further improve the answer by providing references.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I have two questions really: (1) Should there be some way, that is not tangled up in the many different things an up vote can express, to incentivize answerers to provide well-researched answers?

For the average person the majority of their questions can be answered on wikipedia with answers that generally include source(s), but in a way is lacking the human element/discussion. There are many other Q&amp;amp;A sites that are decent (at best) in the answers provided.

Your questions need to be formatted in a way that they are able to be answered with a clear and concise answer. Questions that ask &lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt; are always going to be subjective by the very nature of the question. Everyone will have their own opinion as to &lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt; something happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, questions that ask &lt;em&gt;WHEN, WHO, WHAT&lt;/em&gt;, and often &lt;em&gt;HOW&lt;/em&gt; are going to be much more likely to be answerable with a clear and concise answer that does NOT require speculation, conjecture, or opinion.

I used to wonder the same thing, until I read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and came across where the name came from, and some of how it was justified at the time. IMHO the cheif tactical error that question made was to pose it in present tense, rather than past tense. If they'd fixed that, I bet nobody would have complained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a fair number of questions I see posted that are about modern-day events and are essentially political or sociology questions, not proper history questions. If there were SE sites covering those topics, we could just shunt them off there and be done with them. In the absence of a Sociology.SE though, I suppose you could view History as Sociology carried out on past events and peoples. There's nothing stopping a person (eg: us) from using the same analysis tools on today's events we use on past ones. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could instead say that anything the oxymoronic tag &lt;code&gt;contemporary-history&lt;/code&gt; can be applied to (currently 8 questions) is off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best thing we could do is come up with a special tag for such questions, so people who don't like them can avoid them (or see if it can be improved into a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; history question). Unless someone says otherwise, I think I'll start tagging all such things &lt;code&gt;contemporary-history&lt;/code&gt;. Since its sort of an oxymoron anyway, so that ought to be a nice flag for those in-the-know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll throw up a counter-example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/1638/what-happens-after-a-widespread-social-chaos&quot;&gt;What happens after a widespread social chaos&lt;/a&gt;.

If there is something we study history for (other than sheer fun) &lt;em&gt;this is it&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the answers are IMHO (leaving mine aside) high quality attempts to enlighten.

Even if it is on topic, it reads like an extremely not constructive question, and just for reference the not constructive close reason reads as: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As it currently stands, this question is not a good fit for our Q&amp;amp;A format.

It's horribly biased, and it reads more like something I would expect to read on the author's personal blog than on a high quality canonical resource on history. I'm not questioning the author's opinions and I don't necessarily disagree with him (her?), but I am questioning whether opinion heavy answers is what the site is for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/a/4504/739&quot;&gt;other answer&lt;/a&gt; is presented in a impartial way, but also doesn't really answer the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nothing personal with either answerer, my peeve is with the question. I can completely understand how answerers couldn't resist the urge to answer such a question, but I really think that so poor questions can only lead to argumentative answers and are not the best advertisement for the site.

There is definitely no shortage of questions on this or any other SE site that could be considered sketchy, but we as moderators can't always act on every single one of them. We are volunteers who try to spend as much time as we can looking over the site and trying to keep it as current and relevant as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, I personally do not ever read about 25% of the questions on this site when they are first submitted because I simply do not have the time. I eventually get around to reading all of them, but sometimes it may be a week or so after they are posted. I can't speak for other moderators, but I suspect they do not see most questions on the day they are submitted. (New answers are even harder to keep up with, but I won't go into that right now.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of our limited time, we rely on the community to help bring our attention to potential problems. They do this by voting to close a question or by flagging it if they believe there is something that needs to be addressed. Pretty much every single day I look at every question that is flagged or voted on for closing or reopening. Questions or answers submitted by new users are automatically flagged, as are answers to older questions, so all of these get my attention first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The short and simple answer is that this question got flagged and voted for closing, while most of the other questions did not. When we receive a flag, we have to make a decision based on a number of factors, and sometimes it comes down to just a personal evaluation. We are not always going to satsify everyone, but we certainly try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, speaking for me personally, one of the first things I look at is the number of commenst vs. answers.

Those are easy decisions for me when it comes to a request to close!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor I consider is the number of votes (up or down) for either the question or any answers. Pretty much all of the examples you gave have good participation from the community, and as a moderator, we will very rarely do anything with one of those. At some point in the future as we get closer to becoming a full site, we will be required to clean up a lot of those or remove them, but until then the moderators are not going to act on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don't claim to have the perfect solution. It is simply one in which we rely largely on the community to help give us guidance. All of these factors are weighed individually (and quite honestly, sometimes with some personal prejudice) before we decide how to act on them.

There are many technical reasons that a person might not be able to use the top-voted answer, so it's helpful to have a way of privileging a less popular answer that works for their specific situation.  It's a win-win because the asker can signal the answer that actually solved their problem and the community can signal the answer that is generally seen as &quot;best&quot;.  (Often it's the same answer, which is convenient.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I've noticed that some sites don't work that way.  On a site like History.SE, the asker might be the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; person to pick a canonical answer.  Or at least, there's nothing special about the asker since they don't have any unique problems that need to be solved in an answer.  In a sense, the asker of a History question is not asking for themselves or their own circumstances, but for anyone who will use Google to search for answers.  When Joe Googler discovers that an answer has been accepted by History.SE (we can't expect him to know that accepted answers are chosen by the asker alone), he will naturally assume that the answer has been given some sort of stamp of approval.  That can be a mistaken assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've floated &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianity.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1402/914&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/408/68&quot;&gt;other sites&lt;/a&gt; that have the same profile.

Vote for the post, not the user. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sympathy voting has two major problems: it encourages so-so to just wrong posts and it can remove all new user restrictions for that user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a new user writes a not-so-great post and it's upvoted out of sympathy (rather than because it was a great post), the new user now has a distorted view of what is a quality post and what needs work.

Its a very interesting issue that I'd never had to think about before. I had to think fairly hard about it. Here is why, in the end, I put the PBUH back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The issue here is how to handle &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_be_upon_him_%28Islam%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ṣalawāt&lt;/a&gt;, which many devout Muslims are compelled by their religion to follow any reference to a revered Prophet or archangel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do differ from Wikipedia in one rather important respect. Our question and answer format gives each question and each answer a specific author. Unlike Wikipedia, we prominently (and permanently) display this author for as long as that question or answer exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As such, if a question or answer author on an SE site feels compelled to add a ṣalawāt, I believe it would be wrong for an editor remove it. It is their question, and we should not be rephrasing it in a way that would seem like disrespectful phrasing to them or their community, and then &lt;em&gt;leave their name prominently attached to it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I believe it would also be wrong for a devout Muslim with edit privs to go through here and start &lt;em&gt;adding&lt;/em&gt; PBUH to the entries of those who didn't want it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The exception would be community wiki entries (which have the author's name removed).

Nobody really looks askance at a Christian who just says &quot;Jesus&quot;, and the phrase makes an assertion of divinity, which in my mind would be a huge red flag that the question belongs on Christianity.SE.

Well, absent a confession on Ford's part that is out there somewhere, no on can answer that question definitively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really think, contrary to T.E.D., that the subject matter is really what is at issue here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="579" LastActivityDate="2013-02-08T14:24:39.663" CommentCount="6" />

While im trying to educate myself on history, in order to re-enact the proper way only with my own research, Id have to make several degrees in history and read through a few libraries. Just starting off with some questions off the top of my mind, since I started only recently&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should it exist?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Why, to have and expert source of &lt;strong&gt;up to date&lt;/strong&gt; knowledge about history. I cant possibly follow every archeological journal, specialist, publication, university, etc etc. We need a source of reliable, scientific, high quality knowledge. The truth is, popular books on history are simply swarimng with errors on almost every aspect. Some of the illustrations of medieval armour are more fantasy than history in books that are supposed to be educational! We need a place where we can ask for info and we will get facts, backed up with finding, iconography, documents from the period and expert analysis of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;The internet is cluttered and even more erronous that the books. Most people write about how they imagine history (especially medieval and how its viewed by the prism of knight romances) rather than how it actually was. Also, everything mentioned in previous posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?&lt;/strong&gt; &#xA;Well, maybe a bit. I looked through some of the questions on the site and I dont feel they are answerable in an expert manner. If someone asks about causality of some events, how one thing or person affected another etc. The answer will be either speculative, or would need an entire scientific article or book to write it down. Many questions are really difficult to answer, meaning - it would take an enormous effort to give a reasonable answer. Examples? &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2312/how-did-medieval-armies-survive-the-use-of-mail-armor-in-the-deserts-of-the-midd&quot;&gt;How did Medieval Armies survive the use of mail armor in the deserts of the Middle East?&lt;/a&gt;. The top rated answer took the right course - the scientific way would be to do experimental archeology. In Poland we actually have a group who does such things. They equip them selves nearly 100% historically (they even use hand-woven materials for their clothes) and travel by foot and by horse, eat historically prepped foot on such journes etc etc. They have gained a LOT of high quality knowlege about travelling in the middle ages. Right now theyre getting ready for a 400km journey on foot in the south of the country. Perhaps they could accurately answer the qeustion I linked, if they were to go Middle East ;) Im quite sure they could provide some great community-wiki questions and answers and Id love to see such people here. Im making some questions from the begginer/advanced reenactors point of view, but I feel my questions are of a totally different sort than most of the site. Maybe more such qeustions would interest real pro's?

My involvement with another research-based site shows me that there are two definite shifts in how questions/answers are presented in academic sites and places like SE where the community is more involved in how reputation and answers are perceived.  Experts in some areas, and I can luckily say some of my history professors were not like this, can be prickly when their research and authority in subjects is attacked, which will happen in SE.  I've seen it happen in many questions on SE History as a mod, though it's a small portion of what I've seen it may be a stumbling block with others getting involved.  Especially considering the &quot;burn&quot; others may have had in previous exposures to SE sites and involvement in public forums like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember these are people who spend their time as experts in subjects and some do not take direct challenges well to their knowledge of subjects.  While getting younger members of the community may help, as they are more familiar with the social media aspects of online communities and may have thicker skins for criticism that may arise.  Introducing them to SE History may be good, but the introduction has to draw them in, and I am not sure even the current state of SE History questions is enough to bring them in.  I know this goes back to the question quality problem we struggled with early on, and I can see it somewhat still happens, but then this is for people to have questions who may or may not be History professionals or academics, it's a place for answers.  Consider as well, that while we have stressed in the past that answers should have some documentation for them, not all do.  Many are someone's recollection or knowledge put out there, and some have sources to back up the statements, and many sources are not Wikipedia.  What would be the expectation of an academic who is more used to using sources to back up their thesis or paper?  This sort of loops back to the reputation aspect, here is someone who is already known in another community as knowledgable in their field but here they are starting over, many would not want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll stop there as I feel I've dumped enough.

Some have an interest in a time period, others in a particular civilization or cultural group, others in an aspect of human society across time periods and civilizations, others in a particular school of analysis applicable to all of the above.

Yes, many of the un-cited weird ideas arise in otherwise bad questions (possibly due to the kinds of users who would subscribe to random conspiracy theories?). But they don't cause the questions to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at your examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; question is good on the simple and practical ground that it resulted in good answers :) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khazakh and anticapitalism is as much &quot;common wisdom&quot; as &quot;Great Game&quot; among people familiar with the culture. Whatever other faults of that question, if you yourself accept that &quot;common wisdom&quot; needs not be cited, this one fits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that #3 is a bad question, though it has problems galore aside from the one you stated. You can't figure out what's being asked. Nevertheless, it CAN be turned into a good question if someone cared enough, based on that same uncited idea, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasons for the Renaissance - ditto as #1. Resulted in great answers, totally irrelevant as to what the (cited or nor) theory in the question stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Game - you yourself admitted it doesn't really fit &quot;uncited&quot; mold due to being common wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You seem to be confusing two different kinds of questions (and yes, may be because OPs confused them as well):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a historical theory (cited). Can it be proven/disproved, especially based on research done by the source I cited?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one is MUCH better if cited, as then the cites can be checked and peer reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's some random information blob &quot;X&quot; (which could be a cited theory, or un-cited theory, or anything else) pertaining to historical area of study &quot;Y&quot;. Can more information &lt;strong&gt;of a specific nature&lt;/strong&gt; be shed on area of study &quot;Y&quot; as it relates to &quot;X&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one can be good or bad, depending on how focused the SECOND part of the question is.

That of course is no reason to outright ban the category, but it certainly reason enough for me to not be particularly enthusiastic about further encouraging similar questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A related issue is that the type is also not particularly accessible, as is typical with media heavy content.

This type of question shares a lot of characteristics with &quot;guessing game&quot; questions, although I don't think it fits the description 100%. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are of course free to decide on our own what kind of questions we welcome on the site (within certain broad limits) and I'm not saying that we should outright ban the category just because similar categories didn't work elsewhere. But, it wouldn't hurt to take notice of the experience of others and not repeat the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The low end of the quality spectrum is going to be awful&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is more speculation than fact.

IMHO, staff members of the Stack Exchange (SE) should have &quot;full&quot; moderator privileges to close and delete questions and answers, and suspend members, etc. This is so that they can protect us all from what I call the three P's (profanity, pornography, and plagiarism), and similar problems (the fourth p). That's their &quot;day job&quot; and the fact that their jobs, reputations and livelihoods are on the line gives them the requisite &quot;skin in the game&quot; to do this effectively. The following comments are meant to relate to &quot;non=paid&quot; moderators drawn from the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, a moderator can unilaterally close a question, which can also be done with FIVE votes from qualified members of the community. Meaning that a moderator in effect has five close (or reopen) votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &quot;three vote&quot; moderater would have three, not five votes to close or open a question, which is to say no such unilateral power. Instead, it would take TWO moderators (six votes) to close or reopen a question, or a moderator and two senior community members. It often happens that questions are closed this latter way; two or three community members vote to close, and a moderator comes along and &quot;finishes&quot; the job without the need for five votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could come about in two ways. We could either limit all moderators to three votes, or have two classes of moderators: One or two people with five close votes, and the others with three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was offered a chance by Anna Lear to be a pro temp moderator for the site. I respectfully declined, partly because of day job pressures, and partly because I was uncomfortable with a moderator's unilateral closing powers. One reason I declined was that if I had full moderator privileges (and resp;onsibilities), it would have felt too much like a &quot;day job,&quot; (and perhaps detracted from my real one.) If I had been given a chance to be a &quot;three vote&quot; moderator, I might have accepted it, since I could contribute to the site with extra votes that reflect my high reputation, but without having to &quot;sweat out&quot; whether I was doing the right thing by unilaterally closing something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I've been spending a lot of time on the site recently, in spite of myself. One way I justify this is by the fact that a number of what purport to be history questions are really &quot;day job&quot; questions in disguise. For instance, this question about troops with different backgrounds &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8054/at-the-battle-of-zama-was-the-roman-army-more-native-than-the-carthaginian/8268#8268&quot;&gt;At the Battle of Zama, was the Roman army more &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; than the Carthaginian?&lt;/a&gt; could really be a question about the relative strengths of moderators drawn from SE vs. the Community.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do others think about having a group of moderators from the community with &quot;limited&quot; powers?

Because at that point, you will have done whatever research necessary to make it a good question worth asking.

I'd say it's safe to say that questions from amateurs are allowed and more often than not, enthusiastically welcomed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/579/739&quot;&gt;T.E.D. noted&lt;/a&gt;, we do expect questions to show at least some amount of prior research. We really don't want a site that's full of obvious answers, that would get extremely boring very fast. However it's extremely difficult to define a common baseline for the amount of prior research required. Each and every one of us has different standards, expectations and skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do we maintain sanity, then? Well, that's easy, by combining our different standards, expectations and skills. It takes five votes from high(ish) rep users to close a question (i.e. deem it unsuitable), one or even four persons' opinions don't really mean much. I'd go as far as say that if you don't agree with one person's opinion of your question, you can just ignore it, at least until it becomes obvious what the community's opinion is. There's one notable exception, the people with diamonds next to their usernames; they are moderators exactly because we trust them to single handedly do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I don't think I'm in any way a representative user, just to give you an example, my workflow for determining prior research is a five minute search. I take the more important keywords from the question, enter them into Google and:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I find the answer, I'll downvote the question and move on (remember: a downvote's primary purpose is to show the post is ill researched or ill defined). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I find relevant information (but not the answer), I will comment and share that information (primarily to help anyone else researching the question). If I feel that information would have made the question clearer and was relatively easy to find, I'll probably downvote. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I don't find anything, I &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; upvote the question. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I continue researching the question past the five minute threshold, I will most definitely upvote it. There aren't many questions that keep me interested for more than five minutes, and those that do deserve my upvote.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing everyone has their own workflow, and I should note that (obviously) my workflow only applies to questions that aren't a mess to begin with. I wouldn't spend five minutes on rants (in disguise or not), &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; trivial questions and questions in broken English (on these, my five minutes are better spent in editing the question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both your questions pass my &quot;five minute test&quot;. Obviously, the Australia one didn't pass someone else's equivalent test, but that's both understandable and expected. Some people on the site will be a lot more familiar with certain areas than others, and will be able to dig up relevant information and possibly the answer almost instantly. So what, as I've already mentioned, you shouldn't lose any sleep over what one person thinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you ignore the condescending tone of the comments, what remains is that someone familiar with the subject matter of your question answered it, almost immediately. I agree they could have been a bit nicer about it, but at the end of the day you found the information you were looking for. That's not so bad, is it? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I'm not suggesting that the ends justify the means. The comments, although not outright rude, weren't particularly helpful and you could have just flagged them. Or, just ignore them. But saying that &quot;I do not think I will be able to write to the standards this site requires without getting an abrupt and condescending comment&quot; is an overreaction. I'd strongly advise against letting a single bad experience shape your opinion of the site, especially since you have found at least some value on the site (more specifically, the answer to your other question). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stick around, and give the site another chance. Keep in mind that it's extremely tough to convey emotion in comments. The person at the other end of the line might just be tired, or having a bad day, or whatever, and they screwed up with their comment. Or you might just be misinterpreting the comments. It doesn't matter, whatever the reason for a not so friendly comment, if it's just one (or even two), just ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="739" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:49:21.130" LastActivityDate="2013-06-16T13:48:49.493" CommentCount="2" />

It is much easier to provide a comprehensive answer if you specify an event; we can research the causes and effects of that event and discuss them intelligently.  Second, doublecheck that the majority of the people accept all the assumptions.  Sometimes this will cause me to eat crow; there are questions where the assumptions aren't obvious.

Historians frequently disagree with one another; there are many many historical subjects for which there is no single best answer.  (and the answers change; when I was growing up, Whig History was popular. When I was in college, Marxist development distory was the  One True Faith. Today we have different trends).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SE has a different aesthetic/culture/preference.  SE arises from more technical environments where there is more likely to be a single best answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each SE site can and does differentiate from the core principles. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt; I think that if we are to be successful at departing from the core principles, we need to clearly document how, why and what the limits are. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Subjective vs Objective&lt;/a&gt;.  I do not think there is a simple answer to this question. History is going to be more subjective than (for example) security.stackexchange.com.  We need to develop and continuously refine our own definition of good subjective and counterproductive subjective.  I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; that H:SE's interpretation of good subjective includes answers based on phrases like &quot;success of the resulting state is a subjective term, but if we allow GDP to stand in as a measure for success, then....&quot; If you'll permit me to abuse my own example, then I'll quickly point out that such answers lead inevitably to disagreement, and Lists.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/667/1401&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/a&gt;.   (I'll move this to that question if it is deemed more productive). History is an ongoing discussion of multiple correct answers.  I &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; have an answer as to how we can reconcile the practice of history with SE preference for single best answers.  I believe it is worth examining the problem, developing and continuously refining an answer.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Respect. Respectful language, respectful comments, respectful questions. We need to be very careful to be civil and respectful to one another, and to those affected by the questions.  I now admit that I was unjust to &quot;knee jerk&quot; in response to &quot;colonial masters&quot;, but I'd just read another question that bordered on racial profiling.  &lt;strong&gt;NOTE WITH EMPHASIS&lt;/strong&gt;  I recognize that many participants on H:SE are either (a) not native English speakers, and therefore not aware of the subtle implications of some phrases - &quot;poofy pants&quot; comes to mind as an example of a phrase that wasn't intended to offend or amuse, but which has a different meaning in different cultures.  We have to live with that reality (b) some of the participants are new to history and aren't aware of some of the groundwork. I made those same erroneous assumptions when I was just starting to study history. We have to be respectful when we point out that the world is more complicated.  (c) legitimate differences of opinion.  @Samuel Russell &amp;amp; I come from very different assumption sets; it would be very difficult for us to hold a conversation on many historical topics because we don't agree on the fundamentals. (Once he used the term &quot;valorization&quot;, I realized that we simply wouldn't bridge the gap.) I don't think he's wrong, I just think he applies a different set of assumptions and methods to analyze history.  I prefer my assumptions and methodologies.  Fortunately we've been very respectful of one another, and I'd be happy to buy him a beer and discuss any non-economic issue.  I'll upvote his answers in many cases because they are well researched, well thought through, and well written.  Sometimes I'll upvote his, and then add my own answer because although I respect his opinion, I simply come from a different place.  (Aside: that makes it very difficult for H:SE to identify &quot;one best answer&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to pretend that I have any of the answers, but I do think that we should ponder @Vector's question.

I'm a Community Manager for Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, a vote represents the opinion of a user, to identify whether a question is &lt;strong&gt;useful&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;not useful&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to points about clarity and research and whatnot. Voting is the tool for the community as a whole to judge posts. It is as much to identify when a question is poorly written as it is to identify that the problem being asked about... really isn't worth anyone's time. There are ultimately three states to a vote, though, and there's always the option to simply &quot;not vote&quot; when you think a question is not very helpful in your own analysis but figure that others may find it worthwhile or helpful when pursuing that route. Basically, if a post qualifies as &quot;not interesting enough to upvote&quot;, you're valid to not vote on it instead to express the lack of interest, and a downvote is unnecessary unless you feel it is a negative to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're not downvoting just to express your opinion. You're downvoting to express your opinion on the validity of a topic to the community. Taking a personal voting grudge on, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/china&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;china&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;china&lt;/a&gt; here because you loathe the country and everyone in it, that would be petty. You may still vote as such, as it is your opinion to give, but it's not a very healthy way to go about voting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if there was a subject matter on which you feel that dealing with questions about them is not useful to &lt;em&gt;anyone in the community&lt;/em&gt;, then from that you could downvote against questions of that subject matter. This would be because, moreso than your personal hatred for the subject matter, you're voting because you don't believe the question to be valuable to anyone, which is inline with how one should be voting at all times. It shouldn't be &quot;I don't like this&quot;, it should be &quot;This isn't useful to the site&quot;. Typically, subjects that would get identified in this way usually end up being the subject of topicality discussions - if there's a community consensus that a particular subject is toxic to the site, then it makes sense to bar the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not fond of murder and the like either, though I personally stay out of news often just to not dwell on it. So I can understand your dislike of seeing those kinds of questions. However, I don't personally think it's a subject matter that's harmful to the community as a whole to discuss, so I don't feel that downvoting everything is healthy, neither to the community nor to you as a voter. &lt;strong&gt;There is a more applicable course of action for you, though - ignored tags&lt;/strong&gt;. In your profile, there's a tab in the top right that says 'prefs', which you may use to identify one or more tags as &quot;ignored tags&quot;. These will be greyed out when they show up or, if you mark the appropriately labelled &quot;hide ignored tags&quot; checkbox on the same page, hidden altogether from your view as you browse. Using this would let you navigate the site entirely without needing to acknowledge this subject matter, while not inhibiting the abilities of other users to partake in their own millings-about with the topic. It would also avoid the otherwise necessary viewing of such questions to begin with that downvoting would require.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19" LastActivityDate="2013-08-21T14:27:43.793" CommentCount="1" />

The term has no meaning and therefore the question is opinion based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic system of Rome in 1CE isn't like the modern economic system; they had a defined &quot;class&quot; system, which is very different from the American &quot;class&quot; system, or the British &quot;class&quot; system.  Was the carpenter a citizen? an equite? a member of the urban tribes?  A resident of Rome?  Urban or rural? Citizen of a client state?  Probably most important of all, did the carpenter in question have a patron, and who was the patron?  A wealthy carpenter at the top of his trade who was the client of a weak patron had a lower status than a middling carpenter with a strong patron.  An unemployed citizen whose father was a carpenter had a higher status than a very wealthy and skilled slave. (I realize that some of these are improbable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all the undefined terms, the question is a little like asking whether the taste of green is similar to the scent of the number 3.  Anyone can answer the question, and there is no way to tell which answer is better.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that it is entirely correct to ask why a question was closed and to use meta to refine our common understanding of what is on and off topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastActivityDate="2013-09-30T11:21:26.980" CommentCount="2" />

The top-voted answer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7907/can-the-new-testament-be-a-valid-historical-record-on-the-real-life-of-jesus&quot;&gt;Can the new testament be a valid historical record on the real life of Jesus?&lt;/a&gt; boils down to: scholars are divided.  There are enough questions about the validity of religious texts that many people dismiss them as historical sources.  Therefore if you ask about events in the New Testament that are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/4214/3252&quot;&gt;found in other sources&lt;/a&gt;, the only possible answers are opinion-based.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I happen to disagree with that approach.

For another, it's a double standard.  (We accept all sorts of self-serving and politically-motivated documents as having historical value, so why not religiously-biased texts?)  Every bit of historical evidence should have it's day in court and be judged on it's own merits.  Lumping all religious sources into a single blob is, in my opinion, poor (and perhaps, lazy) history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But my opinion is less important than &lt;strong&gt;our opinion&lt;/strong&gt;.  As a group, the consensus is that asking about Jesus is more trouble than it's worth. However, the rephrased question about the economic status of a generic Galilean carpenter, er &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/4896/914&quot;&gt;builder&lt;/a&gt;, under Roman rule can be answered (in theory) without reliance on religious sources.  It's not the choice I would have made, but it seems to be where this site has landed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Different sites have different rules.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can imagine variations on this question being asked on at least four sites:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;History,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://christianity.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Biblical Hermeneutics&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But each site has its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/respect-the-community-your-own-and-others/&quot;&gt;cultural standards&lt;/a&gt;, so the question would need to be asked differently on different sites.

If you fall into that group, then provide a citation to some other source, but make it a source that someone can check. The goal in this step is to provide references to clarify your question if it isn't quite as clear in text as it is in your mind.

Research is not limited; if you share it, you've still got it.

The question's terminology itself: &lt;em&gt;&quot;questions and answers that are good, or OK, except that they contain some little bits of nonsense or offensiveness&quot;&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that a subjective judgment has already been made regarding the post, even before the editing begins. If so, subsequent edits of the sort under dicussions are danger-fraught.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Such editing may be the result of misunderstanding the OP's intent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At the moment, the policy on SE (AFAIK) is that editors have no&#xA;accountability for their edits in terms of reputation: If one makes a&#xA;substantial change to a post, they may impact the reputation of the&#xA;poster at no risk to their own reputation, although through such an&#xA;edit they have &quot;taken ownership&quot; of that post to some extent. IMO&#xA;there is some inherent inequity here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By way of suggestion, perhaps such a policy should be taken into consideration: If a member edits a post that is not subject to peer review, in a manner which effects the substance of that post, the editor in question should bear some accountability for potential impacts on the poster's reputation, perhaps by binding the editor's reputation to that post, to an extent which reflects the degree of their edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admittedly, such a policy would be very difficult to automate, because it requires qualitative analysis of each particular edit within the context of the post in question, and to put such a burden on moderators is not viable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user2590" LastEditorDisplayName="user2590" LastEditDate="2013-10-02T19:34:57.263" LastActivityDate="2013-10-02T19:34:57.263" CommentCount="3" />

And unless you were exceedingly naive back then, you must've realized how monumental a task this would be... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study of history has always been fraught with controversy and bias, even among trained scholars. Would you expect anything different on a website open to the general public and (at this point in time) populated by folks for whom it is primarily a hobby? I don't think you would, and I don't think you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; - from what I can see, you're a pretty savvy observer. So you &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; what you were getting into...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...But of course, that doesn't make it any less frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the kicker: we don't know if this idea will pan out. There's a big blue &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/whats-beta&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt;&quot; label in the title &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; we don't know if it'll work. Enthusiasm and hope don't always translate into something good... Sometimes, the problem is too hard, the goals of each individual too much in conflict with one another, and that initial optimism dies along with any hope of making The Internet a better place for finding good information on a topic. If History Stack Exchange falls apart, descending into partisan bickering and irrelevance, then... Well, it'd hardly be the first such community to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But here's why I think it has a chance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have no time or patience for the childish petulance of some members&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither do I. And I don't even participate on this site. I signed on to Stack Overflow five years ago &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I was sick of lazy questions, poorly-researched opinionated answers, and endless bickering... About &lt;em&gt;computer programming.&lt;/em&gt; The software here allowed for a few things that weren't possible elsewhere, and with them a chance at producing something other than yet another group of misinformed jackasses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions can be edited to clearly state a problem without unnecessary cruft.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Answers are not locked into a fixed chronological order, but can be posted at any time, edited and improved, and elevated based on their &lt;em&gt;usefulness to others&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Threads can be closed &lt;em&gt;and removed&lt;/em&gt; if they become opinion-heavy train-wrecks. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comments are optional, and voting - the means by which useful answers are elevated and misinformed ones are buried - is &lt;strong&gt;strictly anonymous&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/behavior&quot;&gt;Civility is required&lt;/a&gt;. If you can't criticize &lt;strong&gt;constructively&lt;/strong&gt;, then don't say anything at all; if you're just here to troll for knee-jerk responses or get up on your soapbox, you can go somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as useful as these tools are in overcoming some of the worst tendencies of online (or other...) communities, they're no magic pixie dust: folks can and do misuse them or fail to utilize them at all. It's not hard to find lousy questions and useless answers on Stack Overflow or any other SE site, and sometimes that ends up being all a site can produce... Sometimes, these beta experiments &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/1062/answers-onstartups-will-close-on-november-12-2013&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;this one&lt;/em&gt; hasn't yet, and doesn't need to. Maybe it has for you, and that's your call - if you're done trying to make this place something better, then you're better off walking away now; this should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be something you aren't doing out of love for the topic and hope for the creation of a better place for it. But if you do stick around - and for the rest of the folks who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; sticking around - I have a few suggestions that might make it a bit less of a painful experience for you...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vote! Vote like the outcome of a Chicago election depends on it.&lt;/strong&gt; You think you know what a good question or answer looks like? Then make that known: vote up everything good, &lt;em&gt;and down-vote everything bad.&lt;/em&gt; What's that? You don't think a lazy, unsourced but nominally-correct answer is worth a down-vote? You're afraid of driving away new members by rating their poorly-asked questions honestly? Then you deserve the crap-fest you get as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write the best damn answers you can.&lt;/strong&gt; You can't control what other people do, but when it comes to writing your own answer you have the final say in what it looks like: use  it. Be your own worst critic, and lead by example: if you're concerned about bias and lack of citations elsewhere, make sure your own answers are factual and clearly drawn from reliable sources. Respond to external criticism by going above and beyond to edit in relevant information and present it in a clear writing style. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave concise, factual criticism on misleading answers.&lt;/strong&gt; But &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; get drawn into arguments: say your piece and &lt;em&gt;walk away&lt;/em&gt;. If someone can refute your critique, they're free to do so, but &lt;strong&gt;make it clear by your actions&lt;/strong&gt; that you won't be drawn into pointless debates. By the same token, don't respond to criticisms on your own posts unless you can refute them with facts and without becoming emotional or defensive. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Don't Feed The Trolls:&lt;/a&gt; if you observe a particularly inflammatory or nonconstructive comment (on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; post), &lt;strong&gt;flag it&lt;/strong&gt; and move on. Ditto for questions or answers that are clearly, irredeemably inflammatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voting is anonymous - keep it that way.&lt;/strong&gt; The reputation and scoring systems here are fun, and serve a useful purpose in controlling both the privileges assigned to members and the status of individual posts. That said, &lt;em&gt;they are not the primary focus of this site.&lt;/em&gt; If you end up fixating on them - or encouraging others to do so - everyone will suffer for this. So leaving comments like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1:&lt;/strong&gt; [actual problem goes here]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downvoting&lt;/strong&gt; because... [reasoned critique goes here].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or even this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+1:&lt;/strong&gt; [reason why you think a post is valuable goes here]. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...is all counter-productive. Instead of leading with the information you most want to communicate, you're starting right off with a distraction - and an implicit invitation for the reader to engage in some tit-for-tat rather than calmly addressing or refuting your criticisms. Even if &lt;em&gt;everything else you write&lt;/em&gt; is constructive and well-reasoned, you're subverting this tone right from the start - &lt;em&gt;stop doing that&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize all this:&lt;/strong&gt; if you're going to participate here, do your best to work with the system, to use the tools given you, and to set an example for others to follow. It's not easy, and there's no guarantee of success, but very little of value in this world comes easily or without effort; if you think this is important, then work to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closing, I'd like to thank you for raising this topic here. Even if you did so in an unnecessarily dramatic fashion, the fact that you decided to take a matter that's been troubling you before the community here rather than passive-aggressively working it into your communication on the site itself speaks to a level of respect for others that, IMHO, would be nice to see more of. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:47:51.627" LastActivityDate="2013-11-13T00:19:37.387" CommentCount="12" />

A good deal arrives at the site via search engines (Google, mostly), which is an important sign of success.  You all should be proud of your progress toward making the internet a better place to learn about history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, this site is on a good trajectory, but there are still things that can be improved given time and some effort.  The easy thing to articulate is that there seem to be about a dozen folks who participate regularly and a 100 or so who participate occasionally.  I suspect that the community would be stronger with more folks providing input on the shape of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Harder to address is my concern that the core of this community are not on the same page when it comes to future direction.  Particularly difficult is how much leeway to give askers of controversial questions (religion, politics, verging on bigotry, and potential conspiracy theories).  For better or worse, History is on the Stack Exchange site circuit for people who ask such questions.     The temptation is to tighten the rules so that you don't have to deal with the fallout of such question.  But there's a lot to be said for Mark C. Wallace's &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/801/690&quot;&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; of demanding answerable, civil, and researched questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In sum, you all have built a site full of potential that is already helping thousands of visitors a day learn a thing or two about history.

Assertions like (loose paraphrase) &lt;em&gt;Western printing is better than Eastern because we know the name of the inventor&lt;/em&gt; diminish the value of the question.

For many topics, that's a fair reading: if I can identify the reasoning for concluding that pi is irrational, it's rational for me to believe that mathematical fact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But historical reasoning is often different.

Farley fired upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sumter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fort Sumter&lt;/a&gt; does not make that action rational.  History abounds with bad reasoning resulting in monumentally bad ideas.  Asking where such ideas originated does not validate them as ideas.

I like this question a lot. However, a request for a slightly better rewording in the comments went unanswered. Also, I pretty much had to enter the entire title before Google found it (top hit when it did though). But the worst problem is that none of the answers were ever accepted. The best answer of the bunch IMHO was really too short.

Its worded a bit too much like we are playing a trivia game, but otherwise a very good question. It has a good accepted answer, although one which is worded a bit too tentatively for my taste. Its main problem is that I had to add the word &quot;appearance&quot; to get it to show up on a Google search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10969/when-the-term-president-was-used-the-first-time&quot;&gt;When the term &amp;quot;president&amp;quot; was used the first time?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Needs Improvement&lt;/em&gt;. An interesting question, with a very good answer. However, there is only the one answer, it has not been accepted, and I couldn't find it on Google &lt;em&gt;even when I search on the exact question title&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10793/how-did-the-dutch-east-india-company-voc-have-so-much-revenue-when-they-only-c&quot;&gt;How did the Dutch East India Company (VOC) have so much revenue when they only control small part of Indonesia?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satisfactory (barely)&lt;/em&gt;. Somehow I missed this one when it was asked. The question itself could use a little cleaning up. As it is, it seems to be asking &quot;How do people make money out of trade routes?&quot;, but could probably be tweaked to be more specific to the VOC. It has three pretty good answers, but again none have been accepted. It shows up fifth in the dumbest Google query I could think of on the subject, a pretty darn good performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10913/to-what-extent-did-the-cpc-avoid-fighting-with-the-japanese&quot;&gt;To what extent did the CPC avoid fighting with the Japanese?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Needs Improvement&lt;/em&gt;. I could see a tweak or two to the wording, but for the most part the question is great. Best of the bunch by far. It also is the &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; hit for the first Google search I tried. However, the only answer at present is negatively voted. It looks to be an eminently answerable question, so there is really no excuse for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10903/prominent-examples-of-scientific-racism-in-ancient-greece&quot;&gt;Prominent examples of scientific racism in ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Needs Improvement&lt;/em&gt;. IMHO the question is too long, with way too much quoted material. Other than that complaint, it is a great concept for a question, and very well written. It is also top hit on my Google search. It has a fairly good answer (lots of upvotes). That's where the good news ends though. There was only the one answer, it is probably too emotionally worded, and for whatever reason the OQ didn't find it acceptable. I'm giving it the NI purely on the lack of an accepted answer. There's a very fine line between this question being excellent instead, but it presently falls over onto the bad side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10810/how-did-ruffs-become-fashionable-and-then-went-out-of-fashion&quot;&gt;How did ruffs become fashionable and then went out of fashion?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Needs Improvement&lt;/em&gt; - Judging by my past votes, I personally like this question and its top to answers. However, judging by the other votes they all received, that doesn't appear to have been a common opinion. It was about the 9th hit on merely &quot;ruffs fashion&quot;, which I consider pretty darn good. Again, none of the answers have been accepted.

I like this question, although it is of a dangerous variety, in that it tempts speculative answers that don't rely on consensus historical opinion. The top answer IMHO succumbed to the temptation. The next answer is much better. The question showed up 5th on a simple Google search, which is really pretty good. However, again no accepted answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10961/did-the-civil-wars-of-17th-century-england-facilitate-an-independent-spirit-in-t&quot;&gt;Did the civil wars of 17th century England facilitate an independent spirit in the American colonies?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Needs Improvement&lt;/em&gt; - A very well-worded question, although one that is sadly a bit squishy. The sole answer avoided this sandtrap by instead devoting itself to describing the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, as if a question about that was asked instead. It was (probably rightly) not accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10835/what-is-the-significance-of-roof-charms-outside-of-the-forbidden-city&quot;&gt;What is the significance of roof charms outside of the Forbidden City?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excellent&lt;/em&gt; - A great question. Just the kind of thing SO sites are needed for. I remember researching this myself, and there really was no straightforward answer to be found on the internet (I know I commented otherwise at the time, but that info really had to be coaxed out). The accepted answer could use some tweaking, but is pretty good. Google found it on the 4th hit. Biggest issue is that there's only the one answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final analysis: The Achilles' heel for the stack here in my evaluation seems to be &lt;strong&gt;questions with no acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;.  I'm kind of hard on this one, because I know when I'm searching and hit other SE sites, I don't find questions without accepted answers very helpful (although sometimes an extreme amount of upvotes will do instead). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases the lack of an accepted answer may simply be due to the questioners not hanging around to maintain their question, but at least a couple of cases appear to be due to no &quot;acceptable&quot; answer being posted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="771" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:47:51.347" LastActivityDate="2014-01-14T20:37:03.900" CommentCount="5" />

It is intrinsically opinion based.  There is no evidence of preliminary research, although I must admit that OP must have done some reading in order to conclude that “it seems like England was endless dealing with battles…”.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The entire first page of google is filled with references to SE; there doesn’t seem to be a useful answer in the first two pages of google.  One of the reasons that I suspect this of being a homework question is that this mirrors the kind of oversimplification that was presented to me in middle school; there is undoubtedly truth in the thesis, but demonstrating that thesis requires scholarship and a page count far above SE expectations.  I’m going to reluctantly mark SE superior to the internet on this, entirely due to the efforts of Tom Au to portray complex trends in a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10835/1401&quot;&gt;What is the significance of roof charms outside of the Forbidden City?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Excellent question, because it is somewhat difficult to research without background.  Google reveals a whole bunch of answers that mention the roof charms, but do not explain them. SE answer disclaims strong authority, but provides an introduction. I would have preferred a little more depth.  I’m going to mark this satisfactory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10793/1401&quot;&gt;How did the Dutch East India Company (VOC) have so much revenue when they only control small part of Indonesia?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I’m of two minds about this one; I’m in the middle of listening to “A splendid exchange” by Bernstein. Bernstein provides a clear explanation that would answer the question which is far superior to either of the answers presented. OP asks why VOC was able to make a higher profit than the locals; the simple answer is that the VOC had more capital, and had access to markets where the goods were exponentially more valuable. &#xA;OP asks the question based on reading wikipedia; I infer that OP lacks some of the context/scholarship to understand international trade flows in a partially connected world. Revenue is not proportional to the fraction of Indonesia that the company controls, it is proportional to access to markets and to capital. &#xA;Comparing the SE answers to google, SE is superior, but only because google is utterly inadequate.  The first page of results contains essential the source that OP cites (and if it were sufficient, OP wouldn’t have needed to ask the question) and a bunch of irrelevant material. &#xA;I’m going to have to reluctantly mark this as satisfactory; I want to mark the question “Needs Improvement” because it does, but I have to admit that the answers are superior to google.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/11000/1401v&quot;&gt;Oldest appearance of “brand names” in history?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I don’t like the question; the terms are ill defined. Google provides clear answers for first brand and first trademark, but OP seems to be using the term idiosyncratically.  The fact that I don’t like the question isn’t really relevant; OP managed to communicate the idiosyncratic use successfully and SE provided an acceptable answer.  This is a distinctive value of SE because google is useless to answer a question where the answer depends on interpretation of an idiosyncratic interpretation.  I’ll reluctantly mark this superior.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10898/1401&quot;&gt;Population disparities between New York City and Boston&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;This is a flawed question; OP assumes that the importance of a city has something to do with relative population growth. OP provides no research to support that assumption. I also don't like questions where the title is not a question, but that's just unfair of me.&#xA;Google is not terribly useful; if I were compelled, google does provide tools to restrict searches in time, and I could assemble an answer based on those tools, but it would be time consuming and error prone. &#xA;SE is clearly superior; Pietr Geerkens deserves the plaudits if only for the phrase “the least biased … I could find”.  Because the question is flawed, Mr. Geerkens doesn’t answer it as much as recontextualize the problem. This may be another SE distinctive value.  Again I’m going to reluctantly mark this one as superior, because SE has provided value that the internet can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10913/1401&quot;&gt;To what extent did the CPC avoid fighting with the Japanese?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I hate questions which include acronyms I have to research before I can understand the question. I ignored this question because I didn’t want to research “what is the CPC” and “What era in history” before I could get into the troublesome problem of inferring the motivation of the parties involved.  Wikipedia says that the CPC did fight a guerilla war against the Japanese. Wikipedia on the Dixie Missions explains why the CPC didn’t fight the Japanese.  That said, OP did cover that research in his question, so I have to shut up and eat crow. I can’t or won’t complain about a question that does preliminary research. &#xA;SE provides no useful answer to the question. the single answer is downvoted; I’m not expert enough in the subject area to judge why.&#xA;I’ll have to mark this “needs improvement”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/11010/1401&quot;&gt;What factors led to the 30% devaluation of pound sterling in 1949?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I’m going to recuse myself from comment on this, since I provided an answer. I will admit that I’m voting this “needs improvement” because there are more parts of the story that are not in the SE answer. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's my conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't complain about civility once.

Yet dominance in ice-and-snow sport has siphoned attention from Norway’s initial Olympic engagements that, up to 1924, were summer-only. These reflected an uneasy push-pull dynamic shaped by internal politics, socio-cultural traditions and regional tensions. The nascent Olympic stage gave Norway, which split acrimoniously from Sweden in 1905, needed visibility in an age of ascendant nationalism. However, the elitist early-modern Olympic world also clashed with egalitarian impulses and indigenous traditions that revered idræt, the vigorous but non-competitive pursuit of athletic endeavor. A wider values conflict was telescoped into the Norwegian debate during formative decades, while tensions with Sweden formed a little-known political backdrop to the 1912 Stockholm games. Only from the 1930s could Norway make peace with the Olympic project and forge its Hegelian-like postwar synthesis in which sporting professionalism has eclipsed yet not eradicated traditional idræt  elements. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This indicates that sports history is like any topically focused area of historiography.

So it's right around where we'd expect it to be by the numbers.  The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/857/lets-get-critical-jan-2014-site-self-evaluation&quot;&gt;self-evaluation&lt;/a&gt; (and my analysis of it) suggest that question about history &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; harder to ask than questions on other topics.  Even so, questions do seem to get good traction on Google (~87% of traffic comes from search engines) and the quality of answers is generally higher other resources on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Long Version&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to look at the data.  Either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of users and traffic drive question rates, or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of questions per day drives traffic and user participation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is the most obvious mechanism since you can't have questions without people to ask them.  So let's jump straight to the second:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are a brand new user to History.SE.  Maybe you came from another Stack Exchange site or maybe you found an answer to a question here when using a search engine.  If the site looks good to you on first contact, you might start looking around.  The obvious first place to start is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;active questions page&lt;/a&gt; (which is where you go when you click &quot;History beta&quot; on the upper left of the page). Hopefully there are some interesting questions to read (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10933/has-there-ever-been-a-truly-multi-sided-war&quot;&gt;Has there ever been a truly multi-sided war?&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently highlighted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/stackexchange&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange Facebook account&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a new user will find a few questions that are interesting and maybe be inspired to ask or answer one themselves.  But it's probably more realistic to assume they will be distracted by a cat video someone posted somewhere else.  If they ever come back, it would be helpful to see some fresh content.  New answers on old questions can be helpful there, but the best thing would be a fresh question that the new user is interested in and might answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can make a very similar argument for traffic with the big difference that it's Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. who come back to visit the site.  Search engines like fresh content since it's a sign the information is being curated.  New pages (which is what a question represents to the rest of the internet) opens up new search keywords that help people discover the site.  So the rate that new questions are asked correlates with the rate that search engines drive traffic our way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore the very best thing you can do for this site is to find an expert in history who needs an outlet for their writing.  But the &lt;em&gt;next best&lt;/em&gt; thing you can do is &lt;strong&gt;ask a great question&lt;/strong&gt; every now and then.  In many areas of life the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams#Plot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/a&gt; approach just won't work.  People won't miraculously show up at your cornfield just because you built a ballpark there.  But it can work on Stack Exchange.  If several people decide to ask a question or two a week, you could probably raise the questions per day a noticeable amount.  It might be a temporary effect, but you might catch the next great contributor on History.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;15 questions a day, by the way, isn't a scientifically determined number.  Our current gut instinct (based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday&quot;&gt;existing sites&lt;/a&gt;) is closer to 10 per day.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, which has the most restictions on participation, gets by with about 4 a day.

Yes, it's expanded way, way beyond that, but you have to consider its origins. Personally, I'm a software dev and I got into this site specifically because there's a subsite that deals with my specialty (SharePoint, if you care). Anyway... most people who work in software development have a BS in their field, which required them to take lots of science courses, so one can understand why the sciences are so popular. Additionally, there is a lot of bleedover between software development and fields like mathematics (graphics-based stuff like games in particular can get really, really mathy) and physics, and a lot of scientists have to dabble in programming in order to create the tools they need to run experiments effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the relative popularity of forums like rpg.stackexchange and the science fiction section. Not to get too stereotypical but hey, I'm kind of a nerd myself and I am definitely into at least one and at times two of those things.

This isn't to say that nobody's interested in history, but the cohort that comes to SE to figure out how to add a stack panel on a SharePoint site isn't necessarily going to be heavily into history.

The next temptation is to just delete the thing there, and go on my merry way. However, if you do that often the ensuing comments become senseless. Also, sometimes (particularly if the problem is that post changes have made it obsolete), there's prior comments, or even portions of prior comments, that need to be removed as well. Occasionally it gets so complex that I don't think straightening it out is worth &lt;em&gt;anyone's&lt;/em&gt; time, and I'll just &quot;declare comment bankruptcy&quot; and purge them all. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing all this properly frankly a lot of the time ends up requiring a greater time investment that I really have available when I was just popping in to see if there was any quick maintenance needed.

I do agree with you though that it can sometimes be helpful if a comment is left explaining the down vote, where appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also agree that the example you gave was a fundamentally good question. It was reasonably unclear in its intention and as originally worded the second paragraph seemed to be asking for speculation rather than fact. Which is why I personally voted to close. I chose not to down vote it because I thought the intent of the question was fine, just that it needed to be re-worded to fit properly.

In my book this is a fairly serious problem that we should address. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I broadly agree with what was said by Anver Shahar-Kashtan on the subject, it's my view that closing a question because it might attract the wrong type of answer seems to be taking a bit to far. The voting system we have in place will highlight the bad answers as bad answers for all to see and understand. The truly terrible answers will be flagged and deleted where appropriate and we might, if we are lucky, get a good answer for the question from someone who does know of an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2350" LastActivityDate="2014-04-11T14:03:03.893" CommentCount="0" />

If I ask &quot;What are good references for X&quot; and someone replies that &quot;Sujarkama's Economics&quot; is a good source, then everyone should be able to evaluate whether that answer is good or bad.  I should not have to read  &lt;em&gt;Sujarkama's Economics&lt;/em&gt; and discover that it relies on the assumption that one of God's holy laws is that all currency should be in the form of comestibles.

I can't find anything on the about page that says whether sources are required. The page does say that questions &quot;asking for references&quot; are discouraged because of a tendency to lead to discussion rather than concrete answers. I do not interpret that as &quot;we should not ask answerers to provide sources.&quot; I interpret it as &quot;don't post questions like 'what's a good book about WWII'&quot; or something like that -- it's likely to lead to a lot of opinion and discussion rather than good answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even then I think it could sometimes be appropriate to ask for reference material here, if the question is narrowly focused and the answer isn't necessarily obvious from basic research.

I haven't been entirely comfortable with the conflict in the comment stream, but I haven't been sure how to address the underlying issues. Your question in meta helped me to clarify those issues and my vision for what I want SE to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Are sources required?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think your summary is absolutely spot on:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is about the philosophy of the site, whether we are going to make it clear that sources are not required. . . &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You assert, &quot;. . . information page for this Stack Exchange site says that sources are not required . .  &quot;. I'm not sure which information page you are looking at; with my tongue in my cheek, I'll point out that it would have been easier to respond to that if you had provided a source.  My best guess is that you're referencing &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer&quot;&gt;Links to external resources are encouraged. . . &quot;&lt;/a&gt;. That is somewhat less conclusive than the way you phrase the admonition, and it appears to be a stock/default phrase on the corresponding page of many help centers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think sources are required; I'd be a hypocrite if I believed that, since several of my answers are unsourced.  I think sources improve almost any answer. I think sources are vital, possibly even critical when addressing contentious topics.  Sources and methods are and essential distinction between history.stackexchange.com and politics.stackexchange.com, or discussion.stackexchange.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that makes history history - is that when we hit a disagreement, we analyze sources to see how strongly they support our arguments. If we don't reference sources, then my opinion is just as good as yours, and we're merely discussing things.  I'm not interested in trading opinions. I think there is ample evidence in the help center that H:SE is intended to be a Q&amp;amp;A site, not a discussion site. There is no way to assess the quality of an opinion.  There are common methods to assess the quality of research and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the core, I think this disagreement originates in the first comment that I saw from you - you said something along the lines that one must deploy logic first, and then seek out evidence; I replied that I thought the obligation was to employ research first, and then test the research against logic. That fundamental disagreement is echoed in your comment to &#xA;@litlnemo above &quot;What people need to do is THINK...&quot;  I think there are contexts in which your approach is appropriate.  I am afraid that I don't think that it is appropriate for H:SE.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You cite Soviet history books as an example of invalid answers - I completely agree with you.  That is precisely why I want to know the sources that inform your answers; I need to be able to critically examine them.  @Anixx has cited Soviet documents to support his answers.  I believe @Anixx has a first rate mind and is a better researcher than I am, but &lt;strong&gt;when he cites Soviet sources&lt;/strong&gt; he applies a different critical frame than I do. I apply a different standard of scrutiny to answers that cite Soviet sources than I do when he cites other sources. The fact that he cites his sources enables me to evaluate the answer.  You don't give me that opportunity - because you don't cite any sources and are hostile to the notion, I have to evaluate all of your answers against a very skeptical standard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've read enough of your answers to know that they are thorough.  The problem is that without sources, I can't tell whether they are trustworthy, accurate or reliable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Self appointed police&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guilty as charged.  As the SE about page states, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/tour&quot;&gt;It's built and run by you . . .&lt;/a&gt;&quot;  We collectively curate this site.  We vote up and down, we comment, we review.  We discuss our shared vision of what the site should be.  I believe that answers with sources are better. I believe that when an answer touches on contentious topics, sources are essential.  When claims are astonishing, sources are essential. If we collectively decide that sources are not required, then I'll back off.  (I think the current guidance is probably good, although if someone were to suggest some language that we could insert specifically on the H:SE page, that encouraged sources, I'd support that)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the crucial point - if the community tells me to shut up and stop demanding sources, I will.

Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, thank you for having done at least some preliminary research.  I appreciate that you've made an effort.  That said, unless you have a reason to doubt the fact in question, why are you asking?  Do you have a reason to believe that there was an eighth Pryce baronet?  Are you confused about how a baronetage (or any other title) go extinct?  Do you doubt the existence of the Pryce baronetage at all?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of those questions are valid.  But if your question is just &quot;I read X, is it true?&quot; &#xA;then you're wasting your own time, let alone mine.  There are a huge number of assertions on wikipedia; we could fill up the H:SE question queue with questions about whether any given assertion is true.  H:SE would wind up being a copy of Wikipedia.  If your only question is whether an arbitrary assertion on wikipedia is true, then I'm going to downvote your question.  If I'm having a bad day, I'm going to downvote your question, then answer it by citing the wikipedia page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Example:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39197/1401&quot;&gt;Did Yuri Gagarin really hear a ticking sound during his journey into outer space?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was challenged on this one recently on the grounds that a movie put words into the mouth of a real man; (leaving aside the problem that the question does not include a quote)  By this principle, we can question any quote in any movie.  1776 has Thomas Jefferson writing &quot;When in the course of human events...&quot; is that true?  Lincoln has Abe Lincoln saying &quot;hello&quot;... is that true?   Movie X depicts John F Kennedy as a featherless biped, is that true?  Book Y says that Robbert Goddard had five fingers on each hand, is that true? Unless you provide some justification, some  reason, then all of these are equally absurd.   Gagarin was in a tiny cockpit crammed full of electromechanical equipment and he heard a sound typical of electromechanical equipment. Where is the surprise?   He was in a relatively tiny capsule exposed to extreme temperature and pressure fluctations - my house make a ticking nose when the when blows.  I'd be more surprised if he didn't hear a ticking sound; if OP had asked, &quot;Why didn't Gagarin hear any strange noises during his space flight?&quot; I would have started work on that question, because &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; would be surprising. (I'd frankly doubt it and ask for a citation, because citing every non-trivial assertion is simple courtesy). Is there a reason why hearing this sound is surprising?  I have no doubt that there is - but OP hasn't told us that.  If you doubt the existing narrative, you're obliged to explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you doubt it.  Asking a question here is a request for a group of strangers to exert effort on your behalf.  Simple respect suggests that if it isn't obvious, that you explain why you find the existing narrative unsubstantial. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;How to fix the problem&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a reference to a ninth baronet Pryce and you need to reconcile the statement in Wikipedia with evidence you have elsewhere then &lt;strong&gt;include in the question references to both bits of evidence (the Wikipedia page and whatever other evidence you have).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't understand how a baronetage can go extinct, then your question isn't &quot;is that true?&quot;, your real question is &quot;how does a baronetage go extinct?&quot; or &quot;How does inheritance of a baronet work?&quot; (that's actually a rather good question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Gagarin spent hours checking the ticking noise against each of the instruments in his spacecraft and measured it to ensure that it was regular and did tests to exclude other possibilities, &lt;strong&gt;then mention that&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you doubt the existence of the Pryce baronetage because all English titles are the invention of our reptilian overlords, then I need to know that so I can cast a close vote rather than a downvote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't understand what a baronetage is, then I suggest you do a couple of google searches before you ask, and incorporate that research into your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the assertion in Wikipedia sounds &lt;strong&gt;implausible&lt;/strong&gt;  to you, then I'd do a bit more research and make your doubt &lt;strong&gt;explicit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wikipedia says that George W. Bush and Sylvester Stallone are the same person; after all they were born on the same day, and they are both white males, given all that evidence, how can you tell the difference between them? I've done some research and I cannot find any photographs that contains both of them, but the underlying claim sounds a bit suspicious to me.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about phrasing the question that way is that we can answer it if we can find a single photograph showing both of them, or some other irrefutable evidence that they are different people.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions that involve more research are less likely to get downvotes than questions that involve little or no research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Counterexample&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33560/1401&quot;&gt;Please confirm this fragile assertion&lt;/a&gt; - This is a great counterexample; OP's real question is to confirm or deny a fragile (single source) hypothesis. I believe this is part &amp;amp; parcel of the practice of history.  We have to be careful not to phrase it as  a source request, but rather as a request to support or rebut a hypothesis.

The same certainly goes for politics. That's just expected. If the community at large feels it is a good answer, it will get enough upvotes to more than balance that out. If it isn't then it won't.

A distinguished scholar had called the lack of population transfer to resolve the latter conflict unprecedented.  I asked whether it truly is. That set off a firestorm I had not intended.  But one interesting point was made that leads to a more fascinating issue -- if population transfer is a war crime, then, arguably, the resettlement of refugees to end a conflict, as was done in India/Pakistan, and more recently in the former Yugoslavia, as well as following several African tribal and ethnic wars, would be a war crime, too.  Moreover, the Saudi Arabian proposal for peace in Palestine, as well as the aborted proposal at Camp David at the end of Clinton's administration, which would have forced Jews to leave their home, would also be war crimes.  Is the alternative to keep refugees in camps until they have a home to get back to?  Do we force Suni and Shiite neighbors who have been fighting tooth and nail with each other in Iraq to live together whether they like it or not, and whether their countries borders are redrawn creating a situation where they would be forced to live in a hostile environment.  Would the UN and warring nations be barred from redrawing their maps to say &quot;this side is for people of the X and that side is people of the Y&quot; and de facto establishing incentives for the residents to leave homes they and descendants have lived in all of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then it gets interesting when you ask, &quot;how do we determine who are the people who cannot be forced to move?&quot;  Whose law would be used to determine this?

The answer is always the same:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core premise of the StackExchange model is that it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an encyclopedia, meaning there is no editorial board responsible for verifying answers. Instead, the model calls for a site filled with experts (of varying levels of knowledge and fields of expertise) who, through their collective voting, let &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; answers rise to the top, and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; answers sink down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important distinction in that last paragraph is the very fluid definition of good and bad answers. Again, this is neither an encyclopedia nor an academic course. The purpose of &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt; is to answer &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt;, and one answer might be more extensively researched and wider in scope, but if people don't feel it answers the original question, or focuses too much on issues that the OP didn't care for, it might get downvoted. An answer with good information but an inappropriate tone might get downvoted by some people, but upvoted by others who don't care about that metric. Some might decide that structuring an answer like an essay, divided into subheadings and paragraphs, might be a good thing and deserve an upvote. Others might see it as unnecessary verbiage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second issue, closely tied to the first, is that an answer's value to the site is determined collectively. The premise, again, is that a large enough group of experts will, on average, reward good answers and discourage bad ones. The fact that this is &lt;em&gt;collective&lt;/em&gt;, and based on a crowd-sourced system where everyone down- or up-votes based on personal preferences, means that one shouldn't cry foul over every downvote. It means that some people disliked it &lt;em&gt;as an answer&lt;/em&gt;, even though they might be fine with the research in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Factual incorrectness is, of course, always bad and should be discouraged. However, since the standards for voting aren't as stringent as in publishing, &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; information will sometimes be upvoted. Again, this shouldn't be a problem if there are enough downvotes to balance it out. Given enough users, enough experts, enough votes, a downvote or two won't matter to a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's true that History.SE is still a small site, and an answer might languish without getting the attention it deserves, and end up with a negative rank, all votes totaled, when that is entirely undeserved, just because not enough people read it and decided to vote. The solution to that is to popularize the site! Bring in more people, more active readers and voters, and let the masses get the system working.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3121" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:29:50.373" LastActivityDate="2014-07-23T05:18:12.727" CommentCount="0" />

If a quotation was reported in a publication you think has a bias, that doesn't mean it isn't factual.  A &quot;quote&quot; or &quot;fact&quot; in pro-Arab Al Jazeera may be as true or could be as false as one in the pro-Israeli settler Arutz Sheva radio and internet network.  Either's &quot;facts&quot; could be out of context, too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a personal story:  In 1996 I was with my family for my daughter's bat mitzvah in Jerusalem.  During our first days there, there was a lot of Arab publicity about how they were going to build an addition to Al Aqsa Mosque in Solomon's Stables -- which were not neither stables nor Solomon's, but was part of the Herodian Temple complex and should have been excavated by archeologists before any building commenced.  The Waqf -- the Moslem caretakers of the mosque would have nothing to do with archeologists.  Archeologists were demanding something be done, but the government wasn't taking the bait, I though.  They figured that Arafat was looking for a fight, and was looking for an excuse.  Nothing happened that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the day after Yom Kippur we planned to see the Kotel tunnel tour, which at the time was an archeological dig underneath the housing in the Arab quarter adjacent to the Wall of the Temple Mount (aka the Kotel).  From the Kotel plaza, where people pray at the Wall, the tunnel runs directly north in the direction of the Dome of the Rock, but on the other side of the mamouth walls placed there by Herod and are about six feet wide, I'd guess.  No way did we ever go east of the Western Wall.  Impossible.  Until that day, the tunnel patrons had to exit out the same door they entered, at the plaza.  But that day, for the first time ever, an exit into the Arab quarter had been opened and my tour was the first to go out it.  We were told that the city government wanted us to buy from the Arab merchants in the Old City, and also, the exit would solve traffic jams inside the tunnel.  Fine.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were also told, that since we were the first, we would be on television, and should not say anything provocative.  We didn't.  Before we left, we saw a well dressed Palestinian Arab in white clothing come down the exit to inspect us. I never saw or heard of that man again, despite all of the events soon to occur.  On our exit, I saw lots of tv cameras, but never saw myself on television (probably because we were too well behaved -- bad television).  I saw lots of police in riot gear, and all of the Arab shops but one were closed in protest of our exit.   As far as I knew, I was no threat to the Arab people or Palestinian statehood.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We walked from the Arab Quarter to the Jaffa gate and went to the post office to buy stamps to mail postcards.  Just then, I saw cars of riot police heading for the Kotel.  I told my wife that there must be trouble.  When we got to our room, CNN showed Yassir Arafat claiming that my tunnel tour had gone underneath the Al Aqsa mosque (to do so we would have had to have gone to the other side of the six-foot Herodian wall and south and east -- we didn't -- also construction was completed seven years before).  That announcement, apparently, started four days of rioting and heavy casualties.  Today, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_kotel_tunnel_1996.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Palestinian &quot;fact&quot; site&lt;/a&gt; does not attribute the claims of damage to Al Aqsa to Arafat -- although I heard it from his lips when he said it -- and have it has twisted the incident into a claim of an attempt to judaize the Arab quarter -- something that hardly seems worth four days of rioting.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let me turn the question back to you:  given my personal experience, should I trust &quot;Arab propaganda&quot;?  If you quoted that site to me, should I vote it down?  Not everything it said is a lie.  It might only earn two pinnochio noses on the Washington Post fact checker column. And my gut feeling -- that Arafat was looking for an excuse to have a small riot, may not be the correct context, or then again, it might.  Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is much that goes on where we only have half of the facts and context.  It is difficult for any of us on the outside to know what is the whole truth.  It is similarly impossible for those closest to the facts to understand the context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If my house has been destroyed by a missile or members of my family killed, I don't want to hear context.  I don't care.  And whether I'm an Arab or Jewish Palestinian, I'm not going to go on television and discuss the politics or the military reasons or even the depths of international law. All I'm going to do is cry, and maybe even want vengence. And if I'm a reporter at the scene, I'm not going to ask the survivors about that, but I will take video images because death destruction and tears of the grieving make good television.  The truth might not come out, really, but leet those who want the truth wait for 100 years the historians from the eventual winner's side to sit down and figure out which truth suits them best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5179" LastActivityDate="2014-07-23T19:12:40.740" CommentCount="0" />

I'm not sure that historical sources and methods would be able to answer whether X is a crime, let alone reason about what hypothetical answer might be a crime.  It might be possible to ask, &quot;What grounds have been used in the past to determine that specific re settlements violate or conform to international law?&quot;  That way we're not trying to decide a question about international law, we're consulting sources to determine if there is an internationally recognized principle or method to reach a determination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question borders on speculation - &quot;If .. arguably... would be&quot;  Those words all cause my downvote finger to twitch.  The scope suggestions of H:SE discourage speculation and hypotheticals.   I'm not entirely sure how to resolve this - I don't know what the question would look like if the speculation were removed.   It might be that &quot;What are the criteria used to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal or not?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is an assumption about the nature of crime. If I take your house, that is a crime. If the government takes your house, that is eminent domain and it is entirely legal.  If I force you and your family to resettle, that is a criminal act; if the government forces you to do so, that is a legal act, and any attempt to resist that is illegal.  The situation you describe is a bit more complex because there is no world government (despite the fears of the wingnuts and the ardent desires of the fruitloops).  But if the resettlement is carried out as an attempt by the international community to resolve a dispute, then the action is arguably legal.  Of course I've use the word &lt;em&gt;arguably&lt;/em&gt; (see prior paragraph) and &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; (see first paragraph).  Again, I think the H:SE question probably runs something along the lines of &quot;What criteria has the international community historically accepted to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect the ultimate answer is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mandate of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; - the very pragmatic method of &quot;if it results in good rule, then it must have been the right choice; if it results in chaos and disorder, then obviously it was illegal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not sure that helps, but I thought your question was good enough that it deserved an attempt at an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastActivityDate="2014-08-13T12:25:50.787" CommentCount="1" />

So I'd like to try a similar series of challenges on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it will work:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggest topics in the answers below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next Friday, the organizer&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; will pick one of the topics and write up a new meta post introducing the challenge for the following week. The topic will be associated with a specific tag so that we can count how many questions were asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to participate asks about the topic of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the week, the organizer post an answer to the challenge with a count of how many questions were asked and anything else they feel like highlighting (like favorite questions or notable achievements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organizer picks a new topic and starts back on step #2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People are free to add new topics at any time and when the list of topics is exhausted, the challenge series ends. Sometime later, I can run analysis similar to what I did for the Mi Yodeya challenge series. And that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what you think and suggest some topics for the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;* Either myself or someone who volunteers in an answer below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="690" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:49:21.130" LastActivityDate="2014-10-09T05:37:09.210" Title="Weekly Topic Challenge" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;challenge&gt;" AnswerCount="10" CommentCount="4" FavoriteCount="1" />

I am always glad when someone engages the community and asks how to participate better, and I'm doubly glad when someone asks how to improve a question. I believe that is a vital part of H:SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can only offer my personal opinion. &#xA;First, make the title a question. That helps make it very clear what you are asking. &#xA;Second, I think the close reason is incorrect. I agree with you that what you are asking is relatively clear. I don't believe I voted on this; if I had, I would have suggested that it was trivial; as the comments indicate, the answer can be found with a Google search.   The easiest way to improve the question is to do (and document) the preliminary research.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that no matter how you &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; your question, questions that ask &quot;What was the influence of X on Y?&quot; tend to fall into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Homework questions - the teacher/instructor/professor has taught to this question and the student hasn't bothered to do the reading/research/attend the lectures.  These are bad questions for H:SE because &lt;em&gt;as stated&lt;/em&gt; they are really only relevant to that class.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beer and Pretzel questions - someone asked a random question and rather than do any research, they come to H:SE and ask for others to do the work.  These also frequently fall into the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/&quot;&gt;Gorilla vs. Shark&lt;/a&gt;&quot; category of questions where there isn't an answer, there is no meaningful way to reach an answer, there is no agreement on what a good answer would be or how to recognize it, and even if we found an answer, nobody would really care.  This kind of question is excellent for Symposia at the Pub, but very bad for Stack Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of your question, I would first have rephrased it to &quot;What influence did the cold war have on the formation of the internet?&quot;  Then I'd have included some preliminary research. First I've have defined /referenced the two terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Gore created the internet; On 3/9/1999, the internet sprung forth fully formed from his his forehead like Athena from Zeus' skull. The internet is defined as a set of tubes through which pictures of cats flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Stross' Laundry file defines the cold war as the conflict between subterranean extraterrestrial entities and a possessed cat. (sorry for the spoiler). As such the cold war began prior to the beginning of recorded civilization and ended in 2012 at the end of the Laundry Files.  The key features of the cold war are a fixation on exotic mathematics and computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(in case the pop culture references aren't obvious, those answers are wrong; no matter how amateur your research, you can do better than those two bullets.) I would have used Google and Wikipedia (and possibly Snopes) to check to see if there are any existing theories about the origin of the internet, and I would have referenced that research in the question so that people don't waste their time searching out the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is also useful to understand why you're asking; what difference does it make if the cold war influenced the internet? If the cold war didn't influence the internet are you looking for what did influence the internet, or are you actually looking for knock on effects of the cold war on the civilian technological base? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastEditorUserId="1401" LastEditDate="2014-08-24T21:03:48.097" LastActivityDate="2014-08-24T21:03:48.097" CommentCount="3" />

My argument was that from my understanding finding sources is a typical component of the day-to-day of a historian researcher, and that questions of this sort would likely for the most part produce perfectly useful and searchable answers to questions common in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;@Semaphore argued that questions like this don't have a definite answer (as mentioned as an argument above), which may indeed correct (though as @RosalindRei points out in the comments in the question above, her case should have a definite answer in the shape of a short list). It might still be worthwhile to remember that this requirement originates from the original stackexchange where sticking to the 1Q&amp;amp;1A format was an important point as there were a lot of different &lt;em&gt;opinions&lt;/em&gt; floating around with about more or less anything (this programming language versus that, etc.). This may not be so on this board, especially when it comes to listing references.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I am not a historian, I do feel strongly in favour of H:SE being a resource useful to actual researchers in the field. From my experience with Mathoverflow and from talking to historians, I believe our worlds to not be all that different in this respect. Thus I feel I must point out that I have benefited immensely from both reference requests and more open questions on that site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regards to this it may be interesting to note that Mathoverflow solves the problem of open questions (1Q possibly many A) using a big-list tag and making the question community wiki (meaning posts are more freely editable, and that contributors and the asker don't get reputation points). This is not unlikely to produce a number of useful resources here, as it has done there. Further, in opening up this venue H:SE will not immediately deter historians interested in using this site from asking what I believe to be perfectly reasonable questions for a historian to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple examples of useful resources on Mathoverflow stemming from questions with more than one valid answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/100265/not-especially-famous-long-open-problems-which-anyone-can-understand&quot;&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/100265/not-especially-famous-long-open-problems-which-anyone-can-understand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35468/widely-accepted-mathematical-results-that-were-later-shown-wrong&quot;&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35468/widely-accepted-mathematical-results-that-were-later-shown-wrong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake&quot;&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478/examples-of-common-false-beliefs-in-mathematics&quot;&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478/examples-of-common-false-beliefs-in-mathematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I myself have asked for references on Mathoverflow, where the policies are more in line with what would be useful for a researcher in the field (their policies initially developed independent of the original Stackexchange), and this produced (if several) good answers without having to resort to neither big-list nor community wiki, I'll share that question as well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/68936/source-on-functorial-algebraic-geometry&quot;&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/68936/source-on-functorial-algebraic-geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for how to encourage good requests for references and discourage the lower quality questions, I suspect the nature of history as a subject means that this will not generate poor answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I am to propose a change to current policy it may be to allow reference requests, but encourage the asker to be specific to the point where--and maybe present an argument for that--it is feasible a complete answer would consist of a fairly short (and probably slowly expanding) list of reference material. From there it's a question of common sense:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;E.g., a request for introductory material on recent European history would be too general as a question (but could still generate an interesting resource via a big-list tag and community wiki, as per Mathoverflow), while a properly delineated question like the one by @RosalindRei in the top of this answer would be totally fine with no ifs or buts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6801" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:58:47.433" LastActivityDate="2014-09-18T11:55:08.203" CommentCount="4" />

The first is practical. For example, there's no Anthropology stack right now to direct people to, so closing anthropology questions just for being anthropology helps &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt;. The poor user doesn't get their question answered, and this beta stack has one less question it could sorely use.

When you get into ancient history, records are nice to have, but we don't have nearly as much as we'd like.

Wonderful question. Showed its research and where that research failed. Certainly not trivially googleable. Great (although again way too long) answer. Could use another answer, but then in this case perhaps the accepted one is right, so no other answer really needs to be created. I was on the fence about this one, but I'm marking it up to &quot;excellent&quot; because I don't think you can find better on the internet at large without doing a lot of research yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15113/which-countries-protested-against-the-anschluss&quot;&gt;Which countries protested against the Anschluss?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needs Improvement. The problem here is that the question is really squishy (as the one answer rightly pointed out). The answer is no better though, as it presents novel (to me) information with no backup whatsoever.

I'm not sure how to go about Googling for it. On the plus side, it has two answers, one of which appears to be 100% correct and very well written. I even upvoted it at the time. Sadly, the other answer was clearly written by a total buffoon, and should probably have been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do know that you can't easily find the answer outside of our site, because I tried and failed miserably. :-) So I think despite having only one good answer, and that other blemish upon the face of our stack there, I'm marking this excellent as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15069/pre-ww2-location-of-skalat&quot;&gt;Pre-WW2 location of Skalat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Satisfactory - The question is the weakness here, as it turned out to have the answer right there in the wikipedia page. However, the answer is great, in that it points this out and distills the important info from that page nicely. There's no other answer, but there really doesn't need to be. We were the second hit I got on Google (the first being the wikipedia page in question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15191/what-wiped-the-buddhism-traces-from-kerala-history&quot;&gt;What wiped the Buddhism traces from Kerala History?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Satisfactory - The question was probably the weakness here too, in that I found the answer explicitly stated right in the Wikipedia entry I got from my first Google hit.

Perhaps - in so far as we possess the arrogance to speak for all historians - not answerable by &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; historian with current sources, tools and absence of a time machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance: &lt;em&gt;&quot;How much of the annual budget of Pharaoh Khufu's regime was allocated to tomb building?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can answer these as unanswerable or close them as unanswerable; but we run up against problems either way&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

These are questions where a quantifiable answer exists but it's either zero or many answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Was there a king that had seven legitimate sons?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a paradox in so far that instead providing &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(no answer - implicit)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(no answer - explicit)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt; answers &lt;em&gt;(subset of known or knowable answers)&lt;/em&gt;, the question is closed as too broad or opinion based because it didn't resolve to precisely one answer.

That caused the migration to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt;, which means the original post here on History should be back to normal again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As already noted, one of the site moderators here moved the questions in response to several comments and flags requesting migration. The questions were, in fact, both on-topic at HSM, so there was nothing wrong with migration when looked at in isolation. I decided to reverse the migrations this one time to prevent them from becoming the start of a constant stream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now for the &quot;why&quot; of it all. The default action on any question should pretty much always have something to do with answers, whether it's reading answers or writing an answer. Only when something goes wrong should anyone start thinking about voting to close. That means that if a question is on-topic for History, it should probably stay at History, even if it's also on-topic at another site. This is especially true when a question is old, and/or already has answers, and/or predates the potential migration target site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As T.E.D. mentioned, HSM is a &quot;proper subset&quot; of History, so cases like this are probably going to come up a lot, going forward. I encourage you to work with their community to figure out a better plan for handling migrations (and other interactions) in the future.

The thought being is people may not know all of their questions yet and are looking for a resource they may not know the proper terminology, be experienced enough, it is not their area of expertise, or they are just curious and figure someone that regularly deals in historical research probably knows of effective resources / tools to use rather than them spending hours hunting and pecking through search engines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Genealogy.SE&lt;/a&gt; has also has some contention with such reference lists, but they also do not want to be doing people's research entirely for them (or as Mark stated &lt;em&gt;'doing their homework for them'&lt;/em&gt;) so commonly provide references of where to check both in answers but also in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another topic is, what is the reasonable amount of effort required before posting a question, does someone need to spend 3-4 hours researching before posting a question and then spend 30 minutes composing it and siting what they have already checked, or is a reasonable refined search and attempt to answer the question themselves OK? I would argue there needs to be a balance and also allow for some noise to facilitate new and existing users engaged and if someone seems like they put some effort into looking into it and not just drunkingly fired off a question because they saw something on History channel and was wondering more about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think questions looking for an archival repository or source material that the questioner can then further research is useful if it is adequately scoped and specialized enough it would not be all over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I think questions about how someone would determine something are similar are also technically reference/resource method questions and should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for example and sake of discussion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A) &lt;code&gt;How would I determine the people from Kent that participated in WWII?&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or do they need to specifically ask how many people from Kent were part of an armored division?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B) &lt;code&gt;How would I go about determining the daily supplies consumed by the 3rd Armored Division during WWII?&lt;/code&gt; or would someone need to answer a more specific question like from September 2nd to September 15th, 1944 around the Battle of the Bulge? &lt;em&gt;(Yes the dates are not fully inclusive, but that is part of the point)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C) &lt;code&gt;Where can I find WWII AXIS prisoner lists captured by allied forces in the X region?&lt;/code&gt; or does someone need to know who they are looking for or ask like how many officers were captured in the question so it is specific and not a reference question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In A-C you are enabling the quester, where as the alternative versions the one answering is basically becoming the researcher on behalf of the question taker if it is something that may take extensive research to compile or answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first 12 hours of actively trying to participate in this forum I have seen a lot of opinion and editorial comments which do not contribute to the answer or help refine the question.

This shouldn't be surprising, as the study of History is all about reading and analyzing references. Unfortunately, the StackExchange system is not well designed for this type of question, so these often get closed, as much as many users here would like to answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some stacks allow questions like this, but an examination of &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/book-recommendation&quot;&gt;the results&lt;/a&gt; show that the content doesn't end up being very useful (low votes, seemingly capricious acceptances). What is needed is a way within the system to set up such questions in a way that does encourage the production of useful content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed Reference List Question process, when a question that qualifies as a request for a list of references or books is submitted by a user, the following will happen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Someone&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; notices the nature of the question, and adds the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/references&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;references&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Someone creates a community wiki answer. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Someone adds a comment to the question giving the questioner the option of either accepting the community wiki answer, or having the question held until they can rephrase it to no longer qualify as a list of references. The comment should reference this meta post for a fuller explanation to the original poster.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users who wish to answer at this point may do so (with normal non-wiki answers). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any references listed in a new answer will also be added to the accepted wiki answer by someone (preferably the person who posted the answer), with no commentary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 -&quot;Someone&quot;, in true StackExchange fashion, means any user who happens to notice that it needs doing and has the requisite reputation to perform this action. Users who notice and &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have the needed reputation may flag the item to request it get done.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advantages of this approach: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The compilation wiki answer puts the complete list of mentioned references at the top of the answers (regardless of voting activity). Being a wiki, no user will get reputation credit for it, as is right for a compilation of everyone's answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other answers, all sharing the property of not being accepted, will be automatically sorted via the voting process. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users who post answers will get reputation credit for the quality of their answers as per normal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A random web surfer hitting our page should find first the question, second a complete list of references, and following that answers with references and explanations, sorted by quality (votes).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, I believe it sets up a system where the existing SE engine will provide the proper incentive for good useful answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drawbacks of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It requires an extra step from the person asking the question. Often such people are brand-new users who are likely to have more trouble than most comprehending jargon like &quot;accept button&quot; and &quot;wiki answer&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It requires extra moderation work from alert and knowledgeable users.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't solve the fundamental issue of such questions being solicitations of personal opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Its a big experiment.

There's going to be a mad race to be &quot;first&quot; when someone asks for recommendations about the Roman Empire, because answering &quot;Edward Gibbon&quot; might net you 400 easy points. But even after all of the big names are taken, some users will be incentivized to search Amazon for a book on Rome that hasn't made the list yet, and they'll add it hoping to get a few easy upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is contradictory of me because I think the reputation system, though not perfect, generally creates healthy incentives for SE. I think that's because normally, the quality of our answers themselves is being judged--wanting an extra upvote pushes you to do extra research, extra proofing, extra thinking. But for book recommendations, the referent of our answers is being judged. You can't write a better answer (Edward Gibbon is already as good as he is going to get), so wanting an extra upvote pushes you to post additional recommendations. So I both worry that signal will get lost in the noise, and that some of these threads will become de facto pinned to the top of &quot;active questions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only way to take reputation out of the equation would be to force all OPs to make their questions community wikis (which forces all answers to be community wikis) or to host these questions in Meta.

The community wiki reads like a complete answer. Readers wouldn't need to scroll away for details. Likewise, items can be added to the list without having to make an additional post for the details. On the other hand, the list itself becomes cluttered, and we would have duplicated content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much less clutter in the community wiki answer. It's a concise list with links to follow for those interested in more details. Each item, in their own posts, can further be commented and voted on. On the other hand, information is dispersed through the whole thread, and sometimes there's no need or desire to create a separate post for a short answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I would prefer to just keep the details for my item, the destruction of Wàn Sōng Temple, within the community wiki, since I don't really much point in posting such a short answer separately.

Posters who prefer to put their answers separately can put in a short line and a link to the full answer for details. Those who don't want to, can instead make a reasonably sized section within the community wiki for details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, can we get a consensus on how to proceed with list type answers?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4935" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:47:51.603" LastActivityDate="2015-03-19T14:05:57.117" Title="How should we format the community wiki answer to list-type questions?"

I just don't think you have that if you don't have the (one and only) copy of the full text of an answer in the user's non-wiki answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My original idea was that the top (accepted) answer to the list question would just be the list. It sort of makes a TL;DR answer for the entire question. If you want details about each item, you scroll down to the answers that contain those items. If you like or dislike what the details have to say, the vote button for that item will be right there for you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO that's very important for the whole scheme to work. Expecting users to pick out one they like/don't like, and then go scrolling down past the (now ginormous) wiki answer to the specific user answer that mentioned it, and then vote, is just unrealistic. Plus, if the detailed text is all in their own answers, then you have the detailed text for list items automatically &lt;strong&gt;sorted in order of community votes&lt;/strong&gt;.

You can almost always bet that any question that starts with the word &quot;why&quot; is going to be opinion based. (Why did Joe wear black shoes on Saturday?) Everyone will have their own opinion, so you'll never get a clear and concise answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a question can be saved by a good answer, and I suspect that is the case with your first question. However, if it gets called up for a Close vote, I'll probably vote to close it because it truly is opinion based. There may have been some officers who have stated a specific reason, but without that there is no way anybody can give a clear and concise reason for why any officer would choose to do so.

For example, the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, Act No 49 of 1953 was assented to by the crown.  The relevant law in the 1950s was the South Africa Act 1909 as amended by the Status of the Union Act 1934.  HV Evatt describes the situation as being that the Crown, being the King or Governor General, could only act on the advice of their ministers. (HV Evatt 1936, The King and His Dominion Governors, 298-300)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answer [IANAL] is: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Crown could not refuse assent without launching a coup d'etat against parliament in circumstances that would have produced outrage against the Crown sufficient to result in an election that would surely return a ministry bound to dismiss the existing Governor General, and, potentially, force a republic.  Westminster inspired Crowns have generally sought to avoid such monstrous controversy, and the exceptions (to my knowledge Lang in NSW, Whitlam in the Commonwealth of Australia) have been intensely divisive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The King or Queen or the Governor General could not legally refuse assent without having dismissed the executive council (effectively dismissing a government) and thus appointing a new executive council to advise them to refuse assent.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Governor General could not have legally advised the Monarch, and the Monarch could not have legally advised the Governor General on this course.  If the Monarch chose to intervene, they would have had to done so in person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such an action would have been an extreme and highly controversial use of reserve powers, amounting to a coup d'etat by the Crown over a policy issue (a bill supported by parliament).  Compare to the outrage in Australia when the Governor General had at least the excuse of a blocked supply bill as a fig leaf for what I believe amounted to a coup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sources: HV Evatt 1936, The King and His Dominion Governors, 298-300ff&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="876" LastActivityDate="2015-03-23T00:09:06.457" CommentCount="0" />

I'm also going to specify in advance that I'm not mocking Canadian Coder - he merely happened to ignite a stream of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we set aside the question of power, then there are a couple of other interesting features of this question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a list question&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a hypothesis question ([ask] discourages questions of the form &quot;I think X, don't you?&quot;) - it will tend to generate discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I feel that this is a class of questions that perhaps are closed unfortunately.

What if the question above were reformulated as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis: The fundamental cause of war is a faction's desire for power&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  Please provide examples and cite research that supports or weakens this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would Stalingrad breakout have been a better question had it been phrased: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis: If Hitler had granted Paulus permission to redeploy to meet the relief column, then the Sixth Army could have broken out before year's end&lt;/em&gt;&quot;  There is still speculation &amp;amp; opinion here, but that is, in my opinion, part of the practice of military history.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some nice features (I hope):&#xA;* A good example or counterexample can &quot;close&quot; the question - if I offer, &quot;Hypothesis: Capture of a cite requires numerical superiority&quot;, then a single reference to King Saud's assault on Riyadh is sufficient to disprove the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;partial answers are OK.  Examples that weaken or strengthen are good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions of the predictive power or utility of the hypothesis are good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions of military history are slightly less difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would continue the following existing constraints&#xA;* No counterfactuals:  &quot;Hypothesis: All wars are started by the illuminati to dominate the world's supply of orichalum and psionic slaves&quot;, &#xA;* No pure opinions: &quot;Hypothesis: My child is the best!&quot; &#xA;* No Trivials &quot;Hypothesis: A shark could absolutely beat a gorilla in a fair fight&quot; or &quot;Hypothesis: All Lutheran Preachers in 1573 who were left handed preferred lamb to beef&quot; (absolutely no predictive power)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:47:51.627" LastActivityDate="2015-04-03T22:22:29.403" Title="What if we tested hypothesis'?"

One corollary is that many questions that don't seem to be about history, can in fact be answered well by historians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a recent question impressed this upon me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/21201/was-the-flakpanzer-iv-used-against-infantry-if-not-what-was&quot;&gt;Was the Flakpanzer IV used against infantry? If not, what was?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are currently two good answers; one answered the question by analysing the &lt;em&gt;Flakpanzer&lt;/em&gt; itself, and would not be out of place on a purely-Military Q&amp;amp;A site. The other answered the question via historical accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet there are two close votes as of writing. My suggestion: go easy on these! Instead of asking, &lt;em&gt;is this about history?&lt;/em&gt; let's ask, &lt;em&gt;can this be answered using history?&lt;/em&gt; We should welcome more questions like these because they tend to attract laypersons into learning more about history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical, subjective questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we shut these down too swiftly largely due to existing SE culture, namely one of the stock close reasons: &lt;em&gt;primarily opinion-based&lt;/em&gt;. This reason works well for highly technical, &quot;hard&quot; subjects like software, but is unsuitable for &quot;softer&quot; subjects. History is not just a list of dates and events, the true value is in its analysis of motivations and interests, so we're missing out on a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not that I want every random schmo putting in their 2c about who started WWII or whatever, but expert insight by professional historians or backed by historical evidence is what I really find interesting. We should be more like sites like Programmers.SE in this regard, in that subjective questions are welcome as long as they draw from professional analysis and are backed by evidence. Feel free to downvote crap but let's go easy on the close votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I really enjoyed a TV lecture series by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Zhongtian&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Yi Zhongtian&lt;/a&gt; about the Three Kingdoms period, and contained gems like &quot;was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Yu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Zhou Yu&lt;/a&gt; a jealous man?&quot; Which seems like the kind of trivial, subjective question we love to close, but it was answered by drawing from records of contemporary appraisals, opinions of historians as recorded in sources like &lt;em&gt;Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/em&gt;. Whilst not definitive, as some put it &quot;we can't read the minds of dead people&quot;, it is very interesting nonetheless and is definitely related to history and can be answered by historical study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2957" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:47:51.603" LastActivityDate="2015-04-10T05:15:42.683" CommentCount="0" />

It makes a big difference if the &quot;someone&quot; who once said is a 3rd century monk, a member of the Nazi party in 1938, Paul Krugman, or Noam Chomsky. They all have different biases; they are reliable for different classes of fact.

You know who said what, but you're not supplying this information. That means you're asking me to start my research by repeating what you've already done. You're asking me to play a game where you know the rules and I don't.  You may not mean to be offensive, you may have the best intentions in the world.  But you're playing headgames and we're not married.  You've started your question with a signal that you are not honest; am I really motivated to do research on your behalf?  Do I really want to spend my time to research and write an answer only to have you say, &quot;no, I meant someone else...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doing history without sources is like doing programming without a keyboard, or building a building without any tools.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question is also frequently the same as the example given in the FAQ of a question NOT to ask. &quot;your question is just a rant in disguise: “__ sucks, am I right?”.

The reason for that is that I have ancestors that had lived in those areas, and while they left Germany before the war, I wish to know if, hypothetically they stayed there and somehow survived the Nazi regime and the war, if they would have been expelled or not. I have absolutely no clue how they would have been considered &quot;german&quot; or &quot;polish&quot;, especially considering I'm not even sure which language they spoke, officially they were german, but the ethnicity is not part of the official documents in Germany (as opposed to USSR for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers are not helpful to give me a hint on whether &lt;em&gt;they would have been expulsed&lt;/em&gt;.

On the chat I tried to explain my reasons to Semaphore, but also failed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of my questions seem to be unclear and require comments to clarify. I try to write a long question because I want to show my research effort, so the question would be interesting (we spoke about &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/21475/2395&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, so I will be referring to it, but for other questions remarks also apply). All &lt;code&gt;this citations&lt;/code&gt; are taken directly from the question body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I performed a research and found out, that English kings used the title &quot;King of France&quot; for a long time (since Hunred-Years war until 1800).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The research revealed to me, that (some) French had problems with it, when &lt;code&gt;French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace&lt;/code&gt;. This was the first citation, from Wikipedia.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then I showed that I understand that this was a ceremonial title (&lt;code&gt;Even if using the title &quot;King of France&quot; was only a part of some tradition, this should have been some problem for the French as after the Revolution they demanded to cancel using it.&lt;/code&gt;), however, Mark C. Wallace and JMVanPelt wanted to explain me that &lt;em&gt;this was ceremonial&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Because I had found out it could be some problem for (some) French, so maybe before revolutionary delegates somebody &lt;code&gt;beg/ask/demand the English to cease it?&lt;/code&gt;. However, this was also not clear, because CGCampbell said, that &lt;em&gt;delegates did&lt;/em&gt;. So again, this was not clear and I had to explain once more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Because I expected that the the title &quot;King of France&quot; is ceremonial, I showed an example in the question (&lt;code&gt;I understand that when two kings met on some occasion (or an ambassador was introduced to a king) there was confusing presentation of two &quot;kings of France&quot;.&lt;/code&gt;), why this could have been a problem for the French.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then, Tyler Durden asked &lt;code&gt;What exactly is your question?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The question is stated in the title and it reads &quot;What was the reaction to English monarchs using the title “King of France”?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Did she beg/ask/demand the English to cease it?&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;subquestion&lt;/em&gt; is a possibility of a reaction of French Kings or French governments. I ask this &lt;em&gt;subquestion&lt;/em&gt; to show, that I was thinking about the problem and I know some possibilities and answers, but I don't know if they are true.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;How did other countries take/recognise this title (the largest/most important, like Spain, Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Poland/Lithuania, the Pope, Ottoman Empire maybe)?&lt;/code&gt; means, that I am not only interested in what the French did, but also how other European powers considered the situation. I'd wish that answer will not focus on the France only. The question title &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; use the word &quot;France&quot; in this context.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Was it just taken &quot;it's just a children's play, let the English perform it, if it's fun for them&quot;?&lt;/code&gt; is another possibility to show that I did something before asking&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Has anyone tried to clear this situation?&lt;/code&gt; question is a summary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what was unclear here and why Semaphore says &quot;You write a lot of things&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question is an example, but I had similar issues and comment-discussions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/23094/2395&quot;&gt;the question about UK bonds for Napoleon wars&lt;/a&gt; which ended in a conclusion, that this is not a historical question, and some others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, ok, I can write short questions. This is an alternative:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the reaction to English monarchs using the title “King of France”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The English kings used the title &quot;King of France&quot;. Did anybody else respect it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Expected comments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have you made some research? Go, google it! First link, from Wikipedia, man! &lt;code&gt;French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Which kings of England?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think that this was a problem for France?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;@2 I would say that also kings of Great Britain. But saying &quot;kings of England&quot; may also mean Alfred the Great. The question is too broad, I'm voting to close.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;-1. The question shows lack of minimal research effort [&lt;em&gt;3 up-votes&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This was a ceremonial title, you know? Check Wikipedia before asking: &lt;code&gt;The seven monarchs of this period [1603-1707] continued to use the style King/Queen of France, though their claim was merely nominal. None of them was willing to engage in military campaigns for France against the actual Kings of France Henry IV, Louis XIII and Louis XIV of France.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This question is off-topic because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/619/2395&quot;&gt;asks for a list&lt;/a&gt; of French diplomatic actions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to improve my questions.

If we as a site are generous with our upvotes (not saying that we should upvote something that doesn't deserve it, but we all pass without voting on multiple deserving posts everyday) then we will likely get a non-American hot network question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final step: Be nice to all of the 101 rep users who respond to the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8341" LastActivityDate="2015-08-10T20:57:51.780" CommentCount="0" />

Did something happen? In history, we can be sure only if somebody has written (or stored in other way). But this can be lie, the source can be incomplete, or the asker was not smart enough to understand relationships between two events. So that's why people ask. We require references for such questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, there are questions for which sources exist. If someone asks &quot;Who was Adolf Hitler?&quot;, we can close it. Such question does not require big querying and probably in most languages in the world there is at least a Wikipedia page for such a topic. This is an English speaking forum, so we can assume that anyone can find an answer in English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, in some cases, it's not that obvious. No-one is able to read all the books that people have written since the beginning of the world. If somebody asks &quot;Where can I find more info about Pontius Pilate?&quot; this is not obvious question. We know that even many Christians consider him evil, but some think he was later a saint. Which sources show neutral point of view? Which are a sort of Christian/Jewish/Roman/etc. propaganda? I think this would be an interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, sometimes the answer would be too long and the asker knows it. Let's assume I am interested in &quot;Age of Discoveries&quot;. I'd like to read a book about it, but I'm not sure which one is worth reading. I don't have particular question now - in fact I just saw &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and liked how ships fought. But I saw some ghosts, magic, sea monsters etc. in which I don't believe. What would you suggest me? This is in my opinion a good question. I'm interested in all of the aspects, both everyday living (tools, clothes, were marriages contracted, etc.), particular topics (pirates, governors, conquistadors) but also in great events (conquest of Peru, Mexico, settlements in Virginia etc.). I know there are many sources but which one is the best?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fifth, there can be questions about validity of the sources. For example &quot;Marcus Brittanicus wrote that Nero was visiting Hispalis, while Romus Italicus said he was only thinking about it, and Propius Helveticus said three hundred years later that it was not Hispalis but Hortonium, and then in 18th century Gibbon said that Brittanicus had never existed, which one is right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2395" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:49:21.130" LastActivityDate="2015-08-18T11:15:03.573" CommentCount="0" />

Check wikipedia and google; if the answer is there, then your question is trivial and off topic.

Many pages in google or wikipedia are based on assumptions that aren’t obvious, and H:SE is very good at identifying the assumptions and helping you find pointers to further reading.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don’t ask chatty, open-ended questions; ask narrowly focused questions. Open ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page. Ensure that your question has an answer, and that a reasonable person can identify the answer unambiguously.  If necessary ask several narrow questions rather than one broad one. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don’t ask for a doctoral thesis; ask reasonably scoped questions. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much.   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don’t  ask for sources unless you are asking for a very specific, canonical source. “I would like a book about X” is out of scope, “I would like to know the authoritative source for Parliamentary records in during the English Republican period” is probably OK.  This is frequently discussed in meta; if you’re unsure, search for “sources” in meta and review the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your motivation for asking the question is “I would like to participate in a discussion about ______”, then you should not be asking here. However, if your motivation is “I would like others to explain ______ to me”, then you are probably OK. (Discussions are of course welcome in our real time web chat.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(The above section was adapted from MetaFilter’s FAQ.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some subjective questions are allowed, but “subjective” does not mean “anything goes”.

If you ask Samuel Russel and I for canonical sources on the source &amp;amp; origin of the great depression in the USA, we're going to refer to different canons; I'm a rabid monetarist with Austrian inclinations; he is a historian specializing in labor theory.  We have different understandings of the problem.  But there are two important points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, when I cite Schecter vs US and he cites some other work, each of us will disagree on the priority &amp;amp; pre-eminence of the work, but we will mutually acknowledge that the other is citing a correct canonical source from their historical perspective. He may say that I'm wrong in my conclusions, but he will (probably) not disagree with the facts, just the interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, and potentially more important, history is a verb - history is a process of creating narrative from sources.  We all acknowledge that we bring different perspectives to the table. I continue to cite Mr. Russell because although his perspective is so alien that I almost need a dictionary to understand it, he is always civil and respectful, always focused on the facts, not on ad hominem.  So long as we follow his example, we can resolve differences of opinion about whether a source is canonical or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly of all, disputes about canon are an opportunity to discuss the practice of history and to educate - which is I think the core value of H:SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to put my soapbox away now, and hope that it hasn't been resting on anyone's toes while I've been speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastActivityDate="2015-12-31T15:11:06.150" CommentCount="1" />

In particular, the negative response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27202/16083&quot;&gt;this answer sourced from a religious text&lt;/a&gt; seems quite aggressive - it &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer&quot;&gt;answers the question perfectly&lt;/a&gt;, but has been thoroughly down-voted by the community, with the most up-voted comment being that the religious source quoted is categorically &lt;code&gt;&quot;not considered a reliable historical source by independent scholars&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. That statement applies to practically any religious text; indeed, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/513/are-hadiths-useable-as-references&quot;&gt;a well-written question&lt;/a&gt; on whether (specific) religious texts are acceptable sources for this community that points this out. The lone answer says, roughly, &quot;probably no for answers, but yes for questions [if they're worded right] because they might be interesting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a bit of a double standard, but it makes sense given that this is a History forum, and it's consistent with what I've seen so far on the site. Since SE sites are each their own community with their own self-defined and self-enforced rules - so be it. However, I haven't found a clearly stated stance on this, in the FAQs, question guide, or Meta; &lt;strong&gt;I'd like to understand what the community stance is on referring to the content of religious texts as a reference,&lt;/strong&gt; independent of claiming those texts are 'true' in the religious sense.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Observations:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Browsing the site to understand community attitudes turned up other &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice&quot;&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; exchanges on other topics, and reading other History meta questions on sources (e.g &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/should-we-include-sources-in-answers&quot;&gt;Should we include sources in answers?&lt;/a&gt;) indicates that religion has come up before. One &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/783/16083&quot;&gt;excellent answer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to a meta question regarding a religious topic (itself spawned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10328/how-rich-were-carpenters-in-the-roman-province-of-iudaea-in-the-1st-century-ad&quot;&gt;aggressive treatment of a religious-themed question&lt;/a&gt;) summed things up quite well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some topics are known to cause flamewars on the Internet. [...E]xtremely polarizing topics have a strong tendency to attract the wrong sort of audience: people who care more about the subject than they do about the study of history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/804/16083&quot;&gt;religion-oriented questions&lt;/a&gt; has come up before; but what is the stance on answers to non-religious questions that include material from a religious text? It appears to be that religious texts are rejected as primary sources, often with dismissive or sneering remarks. A few thoughts about this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious texts are generally unverifiable, have little or no concurrent historical material given their age, and contain controversial material that is nearly impossible to discuss objectively. Accordingly, religious texts are basically useless for the purposes of the academic historian, so I can see why they're being frowned on here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they are not generally useful for scholarship, religious texts seems to be completely disregarded, even if they contain content relevant to the original question (as in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27202/16083&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; I referenced). This rejection is often quite blunt and even derisive - comments rejecting that answer use phrases like &lt;code&gt;&quot;sci-fi&quot;, &quot;in-universe&quot;, &quot;mythology&quot;, &quot;a derivative work that cites no other sources&quot;&lt;/code&gt; [quite an oxymoron, that one], &lt;code&gt;&quot;historical fiction&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&quot;[as valid as] a Tom Clancy novel.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My experience has been that very few scholars/historians have put much effort into researching the content, authenticity, or background of religious texts [&lt;em&gt;edit:&lt;/em&gt; before rejecting them], unless they actually focus on religious history specifically. This leads to extremely divisive opinions on any given text, reinforcing the inability to use the text in &quot;serious&quot;, non-religious research. This creates a feedback-loop that perpetuates the exclusion of religious texts from &quot;serious&quot; historical scholarship. &quot;I don't believe the source from a religious standpoint, and it doesn't have enough scholarly research to verify it, therefore there is no more reason to leave my ivory tower to do scholarly research on it than on the latest NY Times novel. QED.&quot; &lt;em&gt;Based on the phrasing used, I sincerely doubt any of the downvoters/commenters on that answer have read the text in question, any impartial research on it's authenticity [beyond Wikipedia, which suffers from this same problem], or even a single apologist's work on the text - just &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/978/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;self-reinforcing, mutually cross-referencing&lt;/a&gt; dismissals of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acceptance or out-of-hand rejection of religious texts as quotable sources in an answer has a lot to do with the self-definition of this community. Is this site for &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99/our-answers-need-to-be-more-like-skeptic-ses-answers&quot;&gt;academia-level historic scholars only&lt;/a&gt;?

SE sites in general are certainly not for the random drive-by Googler, but where and how does History.SE set the bar participation? &lt;em&gt;This is, of course, a separate topic but relevant to the discussion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully stating some concrete criteria for referencing religious texts will allow the community to moderate them categorically without being [or pretending to be, explicitly or by inference] authorities on a given text.

If they don't you're going to need good historical sources to back up their claims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's a book, a speech, a web page, a Wikipedia article, something someone said... they all undergo the same criterion to determine if they're a good historical source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What those criterion might be for the community, I don't know, but I've laid my basics out below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for whether History.SE is for historians or not, that's the wrong question.  It is for producing high quality answers.  Ideally academics and armchair historians can work together to make this happen.  I regularly suggest improvements and sources to answers with potential.  For example, if someone knew of independent verification of the Jaredites that could be added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, another example, I misspelled &quot;Herodotus&quot; all over this answer and @Yannis quietly fixed it. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there isn't verification. It's a low quality answer. It gets appropriately down voted and buried. This might not make you feel so good if you're attached to the answer, but it's a necessary part of maintaining high quality answers.  A good down vote comes with suggestions for improvements, like providing a better source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stick around.  I'm firmly an armchair historian, guilty on many an occasion of leaning too heavily on web pages and Wikipedia articles as sources, and I contribute plenty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For context, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27202/4615&quot;&gt;this is the answer which sparked this&lt;/a&gt; and it uses &lt;em&gt;The Book Of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; (referred to as the &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt;) as its sole reference.  It's about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaredites&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Jaredites&lt;/a&gt; for which there is no evidence for existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I'd like to point out is the comments remain very civil and on the topic of the &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt; as a source.  A few flip comments about &quot;sci-fi&quot; aside, nobody in that comment stream started bagging on Mormonism.  It stuck to its utility as a source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt; was not rejected out of hand.  Several people, including myself, gave reasons for why it's not a good source.  I judged the &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt; with the same criterion as I would any source, religious text or not.  It is a derivative work...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Written millennia after the fact (written in 1830 covering as far back as 2200 BC).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a non-historian&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With a clear bias (founding a religion).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;His claimed sources have never been reviewed (ie. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the golden plates&lt;/a&gt;).&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He hid his sources.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Claims divine guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Regularly contradicts accepted history.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not accepted as a valid historical source by the academic community.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is, I feel, quite restrained.  It avoids the question of it being a religious text and judges it only as a historical source.  Any one of those points is bad, all five puts it solidly in the realm of historical fiction.  Blunt, yes, but necessary because it was continuously pushed as a valid source, and restricted only to it's value as a source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, &quot;some guy said so&quot; is not good enough for History.SE, even if they wrote it down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a parallel example, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27199/4615&quot;&gt;another answer to that same question&lt;/a&gt; using Herodotus' &lt;em&gt;Histories&lt;/em&gt; as a source.  That's also a problem, but it's on firmer ground.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Herodotus is not the most reliable historian&lt;/a&gt;, but much of what he's said has been independently verified... ignoring the odd furry, gold digging giant ant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Histories&lt;/em&gt;, as a source, is &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Written as a contemporary (or within living memory).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Written by historian.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;...albeit the first historian, but laid out principles of objectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;...but prone to being duped (see also giant ants).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don't actually know if Herodotus cites sources.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Usually conforms to known history.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many claims have been verified by modern historians.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Accepted, with many caveats, as a valid historical source by the academic community.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Histories&lt;/em&gt; is somewhere between &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt; and a valid source. It can't be accepted on face value, it's claims need have been verified, and that work has already been done. Sometimes the claims pan out, sometimes they don't. In short, an answer relying solely on &lt;em&gt;Histories&lt;/em&gt; should probably back it up with a firmer source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two very different texts, both controversial to historians in their own way.  Same objective criterion applied.  You get a good first order approximation.  I'm measuring The Father Of History and &lt;em&gt;The Book Of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; with the same yardstick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to address points 1-5, and #3 in particular, which I sum up as &quot;what do we do about poorly researched sources&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;My experience has been that very few scholars/historians have put much effort into researching the content, authenticity, or background of religious texts&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't believe this is true, quite the opposite, but for argument's sake let's assume it is true that the &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt; has not received serious academic attention.  The reasons for that are out of scope for determining if something is a good source (though it might make a good question).  Regardless of the reason, your answer is still using a poorly researched source making unverified claims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A source doesn't get a pass just because nobody's looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also commented that &lt;em&gt;&quot;we wouldn't accept an answer out of a Tom Clancy novel either&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.  Now I have some more space to expand on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've often used Tom Clancy as an example why just because &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; things are true in a story doesn't mean they're all true.  For example, if you dug up a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Storm_Rising&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Storm Rising&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 1000 years in the future you'd note that the United States and Soviet Union were real countries, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were real, the Cold War was a real thing, the military technology checks out, Tom Clancy was alive during that era... it's written by a contemporary and the setting fits with other accounts of the 20th century.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then you'd note that while the setting might be correct, the story contradicts with known history.  Nizhnevartovsk was not blown up.  The Soviets didn't invade the Middle East.  Nobody else mentions a European war in 1986.  Etc...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More to the point, &lt;em&gt;we know Red Storm Rising was fiction&lt;/em&gt;.  In that same manner, &lt;em&gt;we know the BoM is fiction&lt;/em&gt;.  We know it was published by a guy in the northeast US in 1830 who could not have known what happened thousands of years before.  In contrast with most other religious texts that are an amalgamation of stories over many years and many authors which might mix in oral histories and contemporary accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By asking us to accept the &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt; as history is asking us to accept &quot;God told me&quot; as a valid historical source.  This opens the door to having to accept other, contradicting, religious texts.  Not to mention ESP, mental projection, past lives, seances... and History.SE becomes AlternativeHistory.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Telling someone their religious text is historical fiction is pretty rude, but here &lt;em&gt;we're being asked to judge the BoM as a historical source&lt;/em&gt;.  So I will be fair and judge it as a historical source: the &lt;em&gt;BoM&lt;/em&gt; is historical fiction.  I don't know how to cushion the blow any more and still be academically honest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey, at least I picked a good author for the analogy. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final note.

There is a fundamental difference between the nature of (and personal/emotional investment in) a work specifically written &amp;amp; acknowledged as entertainment, and one viewed as having religious meaning. I fully understand the point of the comparison as &quot;can't accept as a basis for discussion on secular history&quot; but it strongly implies &quot;historians know your sacred text is a lie and you're an idiot.&quot; Whether historians actually believe that about the religious or not, it's an abrasive way to put it (as acknowledged).

The scientific method &amp;amp; its results have pretty much replaced religion for many people as the source of truth in modern times though.

Among other reasons, Wikipedia text can change drastically as time goes by, whereas the sources should not. I can tell you from experience that fixing a years-old answer you hardly remember writing when its link is no longer any good is a real drag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, Wikipedia is all about condensing said sources into a short, coherent narrative on the subject (of the page) accessible to non-experts. The overlap between that and what needs to be done in an answer here is so great, that very often Wikipedia is far and away the best source I can provide. I'll follow the source links there, but very often they don't tell enough of the story, or far far too much of some other story to wade through to get the one relevant nugget of info, or both such that even seeing that nugget requires knowledge that a novice may not have. This would require me to duplicate a lot of the glue text that the Wikipedia article provided. Doing that would be a duplication of effort, cause insanely boring expansions of my answer, and IMHO be morally questionable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think there are many situations where a Wikipedia link allows me to give a short coherent answer, at the expense of being twice removed from the sources rather than just once. But at least this has the advantage that the reader has multiple layers of detail through which they can chose to dive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reading back through this, its coming off as an unmitigated defense of &quot;Sola Wikipedia&quot; answers, and I don't intend that. I agree with the question that we have a problem with those.

Why are answers referencing Wikipedia intrinsically bad?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vote up/vote down mechanism provides you the option to discourage answers that you think are too reliant on wikipedia...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of us don't have access to primary sources and don't have the skills needed to deal with primary sources. I suspect that the vast majority(90%+) of the questions should not be answered by primary sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most questions aren't really complex enough to merit either primary or secondary sources.  (Aside: I think that the answers with no references are far more dangerous to the site than those with wikipedia references.  While the GodKing of H:SE can write an essay and cite himself as the only source required, others have begun to copy this practice and just type in assertions with no evidence or references.  Many of these, including the GodKing are full of opinions and prejudices that actively interfere with meaningful historical research.  (The side effect of prohibiting primary research is that it also prohibits assertions like &quot;PTSD is cowardice&quot;. )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;T.E.D suggests that you're actually complaining about lazy answers; I'd argue that the bulk of our problem is actually lazy questions. People who don't bother to do any preliminary research.  The second largest category of our questions (assertion without evidence) is people who lack a critical bit of context to enable them to do their own research.  Once someone can point out the relevant search terms or assumptions, wikipedia is perfectly adequate to direct them to a basic article and then wikipedia references secondary sources that can be followed for further research. I've used this multiple times in my answers, citing Wikipedia for the general concepts and then following through the references that are most valuable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is the generic food of source material.  It is adequate for most general uses.  I think it would be a crying shame if we stopped answering questions because we couldn't answer with a primary source reference.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I look at the five most recent questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/27478/1401&quot;&gt;How many warriors (troops) did feudal vassals have to provide to the king?&lt;/a&gt; - there is no value in consulting primary sources for that question.  You'd have to provide citations to hundreds of sources before you could begin to answer the question. Wikipedia will provide limited value, although perhaps the article on Feudalism might be helpful to OP.  The question contains a huge flawed assumption about uniformity and models of historical behavior.  The question is best answered by a brief essay (or closure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/27481/1401&quot;&gt;How does the US main battle rifle, the m4a1, stack up against other western main battle rifles?&lt;/a&gt; Another question that might be best closed.  We could cite primary sources  - probably the US Army comparison and evaluation reports (Analysis of Alternatives in my field; I'm sure the Army has a different name for the reports). These are likely to be far too technical to be of general use, and to really answer the question you're going to have to pull similar reports from other armies.  The easy part is the &quot;when will it be replaced?&quot; - That answer is probably in the document.  Wikipedia may have a page on infantry weapons that is probably more closely matched to OP's request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/27476/1401&quot;&gt;What divided the Roman Catholic church from the Russian Orthodox church of Russia?&lt;/a&gt;  If you have to ask that question, then primary sources will not help you. Primary sources for this question are going to require so much contextual support that a secondary source is better served.

A lot of these questions attract really poor answers, but I think we should &lt;strong&gt;blame the bad answers, not the question.&lt;/strong&gt; Look at that close reason again:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many good questions generate &lt;strong&gt;some degree of opinion based on expert experience&lt;/strong&gt;, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's focus on that first part, and for us this means:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Good answers are supported by good historical sources&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Good answers cite the opinions of professional historians, and don't rely on personal speculation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So before you close a question using that reason, consider: do you really know the topic well, and know that there are no historical sources that address the question? Sometimes it's hard to tell a good &quot;why&quot; question from a bad one.

I cannot give an example because the questions of this sort that I know have been removed, but I can explain how a question can constitute a propaganda.&#xA;A question may contain &quot;implicit assumptions&quot; (in fact many questions do).

I hope everyone understands what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now how should we fight this. First of all, by voting down. I suppose an accepted answer can be voted down. Is it reasonable to empower the administrators to remove some answers? Even those accepted? If there is a sufficient number of downvotes and tags. I think this is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Administrators should not decide themselves what constitutes propaganda and what is not. We should be relying on votes and tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now why should we single out Nazi propaganda/antisemitism? Or right-wing propaganda? I understand it is most obnoxious, because it is related to the hudge mass murder in the recent past.&#xA;But left-wing propaganda can be also obnoxious. I do not want to give examples,&#xA;(read political articles of people like Noam Chomsky yourself, if you want examples). And it can be neither left nor right. (Example: Russian state-sponsored &quot;news&quot; about the recent events in Ukraine which flood the media).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons I propose to introduce a reason for closing vote &quot;political propaganda&quot;, and a corresponding tag for the answers.

I already proposed to ban this user. And I repeat my proposal: after all, this is a third offence, and I hope the moderators have access to his deleted &quot;questions&quot;.

The community will be relatively conservative about duplication - we want 1 reference question/topic, we do not want lots of closely related references.

Potential additions or alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We don't do reference questions - we permit the tag wiki to contain a list of references for that tag.  @called2voyage expresses a concern that tag wiki's may not drive enough traffic to make the result reliable.  I'm not sure I understand the concern; the proposal would be better than the current reference system for H:SE. I'm not sure I understand the relationship between traffic and reliability (at the core, the problem may be that I don't understand how the term &quot;reliability&quot; is being used).   In any case, I feel that I should amplify that I suggest the tag wiki because it seems to me to be the most intuitive place to look for resources, and it re-uses existing mechanisms. It requires minimal cultural adoption, and it scales well.  I don't think that any of the potential solutions will be &quot;reliable&quot; and I don't anticipate any of them being high traffic.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In order to avoid debate/discussion, reference questions will have one answer that contains a list of all the canonical or commonly approved sources.  Other answers can contain proposed resources. Any source that achieves a minimum score will be added to the canonical.  This makes the debate explicit - up &amp;amp; down votes can be used to identify higher quality resources which are then moved to the &quot;accepted&quot; list. &lt;em&gt;NOTE: this seems to have support and will probably be moved to A - the only reason I'm not moving it now is that it will break the references in comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every reference question should have precisely two tags - the &quot;reference question&quot; tag and a topic tag.  All references must be tightly relevant to that tag.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We don't delete answers with deprecated references - we annotate the answer with the reason why.  (I don't remember which eminent computer scientist ?(Allan Kay?) suggested that the best reference for every topic is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

For example, must English writers use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Latin Script&lt;/a&gt;.

Chinese most notably is a logogram-based system. The word &quot;script&quot; covers both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking through what we have for that tag, it indeed mostly seems to be used for questions about the historical mechanics of writing. For example questions about glyphs used for specific old languages. Only one of the six is actually a question about the meaning of the information in an old work. Such a question would certainly be on-topic here though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now looking through your proposal, I'm not sure how much of a match you'd call that. It seems to me you are shooting for questions about interpreting the information in old documents, but to me its very confusing. The next two most common meanings of the word &quot;script&quot; I'm familiar with are (in order) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ordered set of lines and direction used to plan out a play, TV show, movie, or similar performance work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An abbreviation for manuscript. Typically this means an unedited draft of a written work. However, sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Manuscript&lt;/a&gt; is used to mean a hand-written work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone was talking specifically about old writings, I'd expect to see the term &quot;ancient manuscript&quot;. If I see &quot;script&quot;, an ancient manuscript would be pretty low on my mental rolodex of things the writer could be referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a third meta-criticism:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying this is what you are doing, (because frankly I don't understand your proposed domain right now), but I'd advise anyone creating a proposal that's essentially a proper subset of this stack to be realistic about what you are getting into. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We average about 5 questions a day here. That's not horrible, but its still &quot;beta&quot; level. You shouldn't expect to get more than that with a subset of our domain, and will likely get a fair bit less.

Of course the Premise was false and that's what you proved in your answer. However if we ignore that, this would result in primarily opinion based debate with numerous users proposing different hypothesis and disagreeing with each other e.g. difficult terrain, weather, no resources (Until oil was discovered). I reworded the question to &quot;Has Saudi Arabia ever been invaded?&quot;. Now this phrasing does not lead to opinion based debate and can be answered with facts, as you did. However, It still violates the policy as it is trivia request and about basic historical facts which can be looked up in one simple google search. The closing reason correctly states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Requests for trivia or basic historical facts are off-topic if they&#xA;  can be easily answered by looking up the relevant topic on&#xA;  Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt;.

This should not have been closed as it is about history of Geographical features of the Planet.

Your own answer is focused on a personal experience in proving the event, it does not answer why do some people deny it ever happened. The closing reason is quite clear that People who are experts in Psychology would be better equipped to answer a question related to human behavior of denial than those on History Stack Exchange:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Questions on social sciences other than History are off-topic&#xA;  here&lt;/strong&gt;, unless they also involve history in some fashion.

The first Close Vote was casted with reason &quot;Unclear what you're asking&quot; which is absurd as it is absolutely clear what the OP is asking. OTOH, It is too broad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can argue that you did manage to answer but Pardon me if I say it is not really a great answer(Great here defined as an answer which covers everything asked in the Question in required depth and details).

For Mathematica (and I assume other SE programming sites), it works very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do we try to do that here? Quite often, there are questions where no research, not even a cursory look into Wikipedia have been performed. These questions are irritating; I think they should definitely be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, take as an example &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/33024/bureaucratic-structure-of-the-state-during-the-ottoman-empire&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic structure of the state during the Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; which has been recommended for closure. The OP starts with what I find to be a decent question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To what extent did the bureaucratic structure of the state that were required to sustain the Ottoman’s wealth and power undermine (damage or weaken) the foundations of the Ottoman state in the late 19th and 20th centuries?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question will relate to the technical advances in political administration and cultural comparison. Both of which are interesting (at least to me) when comparing the Ottoman administrative techniques to those of contemporary western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the OP takes a stab at answering the question. A quick read through their theory shows that the OP doesn't know enough historiography to take a stab creating a quality answer. It would be very difficult for the OP, without a few years of reading, to find the answer. So the OP has done some basic research, and then came to SE History to ask us, &quot;the experts&quot; for help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the comments by @MarkC.Wallace then asks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you advancing a theory and asking for proof, or are you asking for the answer to a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically, this comment indicates a preference for no effort put forth by the OP? In my opinion, it seems like there is a catch 22 for new SE History members: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Need to show some basic effort&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, don't put forth evidence that you've put in some effort, or your question will be rejected as pushing a pet theory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might mean that we have a poorly defined standard for good questions.

There is a process for dealing with them, the front end of which is driven by flags from users (associated downvotes and close votes help to drive home the point as well). If a user is consistently getting a lot of those for a specific type of action, they are supposed to get a &lt;strong&gt;warning&lt;/strong&gt; from the moderators, and if they persist in the same behavior, a short suspension. Subsequent infractions for the same thing result in longer suspensions. We have at least one user who &quot;tested&quot; this process to such an extent that he is now suspended for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the root of this process is user flags. That means there may be a lot of time that passes, and a lot of flags raised, before a persistent problem user is supsended for a long period of time. The shorter suspensions before that, you might not even notice. This leads to a lot of user frustration, before the process finally reaches fruition (or the user decides to straighten up and fly right).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would ask in the meantime, please try not to be vindictive about it.

That's because &quot;burning things down&quot; isn't usually the only step up from a peaceful protest, it usually goes hand-in-hand with greater violence towards other people (police, other security services, etc) and looting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prove that &quot;burning things down&quot; was a factor, you have to indulge in a counter-factual (which are frowned upon here). That is, you have to prove that remaining peaceful (or simply not &quot;burning things down&quot;) wouldn't have ultimately provided the same result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of prior research. The downvote button lists &quot;This question does not show any research effort&quot; as a reason to down vote. As written, this question doesn't demonstrate any prior research (i.e. what do you know already, what have you discounted, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too broad. A &quot;protest&quot; can be anything from a local dispute to a country-wide revolution. Successful revolutions can be peaceful but there's usually some fighting involved (and that usually includes some &quot;burning things down&quot;). So any successful violent revolution would count. At the other end of the scale, a protest over the siting of, say, an abortion clinic could turn nasty. If it results in the building being burned down then it could also be claimed as a successful example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you've identified yourself, this is a list question.

I drafted a comment on the main site and decided not to post it because I felt I was contributing to argument rather than to answers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I read the question, two examples of protests that successfully influenced public policy sprang to mind. But if I were to name the examples, I believe it would generate a pointless discussion about the politics of the issues involved.  Discussion of whether the protests were legitimate, were they effective, was the policy changed in response to the protests or not, was the policy prudent or foolish, etc.  In short, if I name the example, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; expect to generate discussion about the examples, not about the principle in the question (I please guilty to cynicism, but it is &lt;em&gt;informed&lt;/em&gt; cynicism).  I chose not to post.  I chose to vote to close on that basis.  I think the question (and any answer to the question) relies on terms and concepts and opinions that are not suited to the kind of historical analysis performed on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, my professional historian girlfriend and I were discussing this question in the car on the way home from lunch, trying to figure out how to revise the question to isolate the effect of protest on public policy while avoiding the discussion of the individual policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, there is no commonly agreed upon mechanism to link protest movements to changes in public policy.  There is no clear criteria that enables us to say - &quot;Protest movement X resulted in change Y&quot;, without someone saying, &quot;Protest movement X was really about Z&quot;, or &quot;Change Y was driven by faction W, not protest X&quot; or &quot;Protest Movement P was similar to protest movement X in all ways, but did not result in change, so your thesis is invalid&quot;.  I would submit that only book length answers are going to indisputably establish the criteria, and book length answers are out of scope for H:SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;List questions make it very difficult to choose an unambiguous authoritative answer.

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion#Later_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article includes an entire section on post-conflict analysis.

As the site help files suggest, H:SE exists to supplement Wikipedia and Google, not to replace them.   In May of 2014 the first comment alerted you to the problem, but you provided no response.  One of the best ways to demonstrate that you've done the preliminary research is to provide a link to the research. and a comment indicating why that research didn't answer your question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;asked &quot;Why not&quot; - Questions that ask why something &lt;strong&gt;didn't&lt;/strong&gt; happen are always marginal - the site conventions clearly indicate that speculation and alternative history are off topic.  Historical sources and methods can be used to analyze things that did happen, but even with history that actually happened, history can't always provide a credible causality.   Once we cross the border into analyzing things that didn't happen, historical sources and methods are much weaker.  I think there is some latitude for military questions because post-action analysis is a common part of military history. If you'd addressed some of the other issued, the question might have passed muster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your question provided three assertions without supporting evidence (they were funded, they were armed, they were supplied), and implies that those three facts should have led to victory. If military planning were that simple, the Secretary of Defense would be paid a lot less.  War is an adversarial endeavor; just as no battle plan survives contact with the enemy, there is frequently no clear cut cause for actions and outcomes.  These unsupported, unsourced, non-trivial assertions cause the question to read less like a request for a historical answer, and more like political speech.  If you want to re-open the question, you might flip these assertions into questions. (Note: this is my opinion; there are others who will disagree because they feel that subquestions are anathema.)  If you're really asking for an analysis of the relative importance of funding, armament and logistics in the success of this military action, then ask that question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my personal opinion, the quesiton is on the edge.

If the question is likely to be closed on the destination site anyway, don't bother migrating it. Just close it normally and advise the OP of the other site in the comments. If they decide to improve the question, then they can go post it over there, or they can edit their question and have it migrated later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid migrating answered questions.&lt;/strong&gt; The point of migration is to send the question to a place where it is on-topic and &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get answered. If the OP already has an answer, then we've already defeated the purpose of migration and the destination site won't have anything to do with the question. Avoid migrating these questions unless they are of extremely good quality and risk deletion on their current site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't migrate for the sake of migration.&lt;/strong&gt; We only migrate questions because they are &lt;em&gt;off-topic on the original site&lt;/em&gt;. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. As a general rule, if someone asks a question &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, and it's on-topic &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, it should stay &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be familiar with the destination site.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have never even visited the destination site before, read through the FAQ thoroughly and &lt;em&gt;make sure&lt;/em&gt; the question actually belongs there. Don't look at the name of a site and automatically assume the question can be asked there. Each site has its own rules, and rules vary greatly across sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're not sure, don't migrate it.&lt;/strong&gt; Let someone else who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; sure do that, or ask for opinions from the community in a relevant chat room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What causes a migration to be rejected and what happens after?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A migration can be automatically rejected before it even gets migrated if any of the following conditions apply:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The user is question-banned or suspended on the destination site&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The question does not contain any tags that exist on the destination site (and the destination site isn't a meta site)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The question is an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; duplicate of &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/97632/check-to-make-sure-a-duplicate-does-not-exist-before-migrating/225679#225679&quot;&gt;another question on the destination site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A question can also be rejected by the target community after it has already been migrated if it gets closed as a reason other than duplicate, or gets deleted (usually by the owner) on the target site.

You brought up the conspiracy theories, and questions which are only answerable by opinion or can't be answered are often just used as a way of getting some bizarre opinion in print online for his buddies to see. The problem falls when we have to draw the line between the wacko's and the serious uniformed questioner. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do we answer the &quot;Is there any &lt;em&gt;historical evidence&lt;/em&gt; that Bigfoot didn't assassinate Kennedy&quot; with the &quot;NO proof that did not happen&quot; answer?

I also believe answers make it more difficult to remove from the server, but I'm not sure on that point. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally hate the close rate and some of the rules we have. I cringe on some of the 'no homework' and 'no book reviews' closes, hoping a child somewhere didn't just get denied a chance to develop an interest in History. There are times I'll admit to putting an answer on a question I knew would be closed, because I found an answer I thought relevant. And I'll accept the downvotes accordingly.  At times I wonder if the closing process shouldn't have some time limit, like question will be closed 24 hours after the last close vote to give the OP time to fix a bad question. (But then there are offensive idiots that you can't close quick enough).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is we have a set of guidelines to follow, and we have to assume the semi-democratic procedures in place will allow the process to operate in a hopefully logical, and unbiased way to protect the validity of the questions and answers we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16951" LastActivityDate="2017-06-09T19:00:49.207" CommentCount="3" />

Wish I had done that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, let me recommend that we update the tag wiki to resolve the question. Although &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; would suggest that the tag wiki indicate that the tag should only be used for questions about the Protestant church beginning at the Protestant reformation. OP would probably argue that the tag should be applied to questions about the Protestant Church &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the events that enabled the church.  I believe that &lt;strong&gt;an&lt;/strong&gt; answer is more important than &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; answer; that a bad concurrence is better than a virtuous argument.  (Perhaps we could create two tags - one that refers to the Protestant church after the reformation and a second tag the refers to the origin of the Protestant church?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; OP were asking about the Protestant church, I would agree that the tag would be appropriate.  However, his insistence that he is looking for Protest sources prior to the Protestant reformation undermines his assertion.  The tag war is a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OP is extending from Foxes assertion that all of these sects were martyrs to the Protestant faith to reach the conclusion that the Protestant Church existed before the reformation.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let's do the comparative advantage analysis : &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we use the tag, then users searching for Protestant Church will find this question and learn things which are false; this diminishes the value of H:SE. OP's experience will not be diminished; I will assert that there is nobody who would answer the question with the tag who would not answer the question without the tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we don't use the tag, OP's experience will not be changed.

Nobody's search will be diminished, since nobody is going to search for Protestant Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(OP would counter argue that these early dissenters were formative for the Protestant Church. I can't remember the name of that fallacy, but essentially it is a recursion problem without a stopping condition.  Everything is affected by things that come before, but by that logic the big bang is formative for teh Protestant church.  Common sense should apply, and we should not (in the general case) apply a tag to events the preceeded the existence of that tag.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least as far as I can see the greater benefit is to remove the tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastActivityDate="2017-08-09T21:24:19.870" CommentCount="3" />

It didn't look to have much to do with history, but I happened to know the answer, so I answered it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was asked whether this had ever actually happened in practice in a comment on my answer. I thought this was a good question, and updated the original question, and my answer, to reflect it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One comment suggested that my &quot;surgical edit&quot; meant that the question met the &quot;threshold&quot; for History:SE, but that it would be a better fit for Politics:SE. I'm not sure exactly what this &quot;threshold&quot; is, or where it's documented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, the question was migrated to Politics:SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then we had a question about whether the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39555/24858&quot;&gt;1864 US presidential election could have been postponed without a constitutional amendment&lt;/a&gt;. Now, this looks to be a pretty clear. It's a question about history, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apparently not. The consensus view again seems to be that this should be on Politics:SE.

All factually correct, although the OP failed to cite their&#xA;sources in the question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then there is a question: would a delay have been possible without a constitutional amendment? Now, that is a matter of fact, and can be answered with historical evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then the OP quotes the results of a recent poll (and subsequently added a link to their source).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, the OP asked a follow-up question: &quot;Would the legal feasibility of such a postponement be any different from the 1864 case?&quot; - again, a matter of fact and, as it happens, actually answered with the same historical sources as the first question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, nothing counterfactual there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Perhaps this is a good time to mention that I'm not a registered user on Politics:SE for (what I consider to be) two very good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is that - as far as I can see - too much of their content is opinion, rather than evidence, based.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second reason I've avoided Politics:SE is that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a lot of counterfactual argument/discussion there. Frankly, I wasted far too much of my life on discussions about counterfactual history when I was an undergrad/postgrad student of history/archaeology.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question is currently closed as &quot;off-topic&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, a couple of days ago, we had a question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39582/24858&quot;&gt;whether an American political party had a legal personality anywhere at any time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, the almost knee-jerk reaction in the comments seemed to be &quot;This should be on Politics:SE&quot;. One comment even suggesting that it had already been asked and answered there (it hadn't).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time, there's been a bit more debate in the comments about whether the question is on topic here. As I write, the question remains open ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the fact remains that three questions have attracted close votes in the last couple of weeks on the basis that they are about politics - even though two of them (arguably all of them, if the comment about the &quot;threshold&quot; is taken at face value) are clearly about the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; of politics).

That is clearly history. The fact that the Federal Election Act (FEA) of 1971 addresses this point doesn't make it (predominantly) politics, because the question was about what happened before the FEA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question was about whether &quot;the 1864 Presidential election &lt;em&gt;could have been&lt;/em&gt; postponed...&quot; The &quot;could have been&quot; makes the question hypothetical or counterfactual, because it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; postponed. The question then goes on to ask what lessons can be drawn for the 2020 election (futuristic and political,not historical.) I might have accepted a question about 1864, worded as &quot;what rules in place governed the 1864 proposal for postponement without a constitutional amendment&quot; (the proposal is historical, the postponement is not). But adding &quot;current events&quot; to a supposedly historical question was too much for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last thing, as you rightly pointed out.

In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/258364757/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester Guardian doesn't mention &quot;&lt;em&gt;World War 1&lt;/em&gt;&quot; or the &quot;&lt;em&gt;First World War&lt;/em&gt;&quot; at all (the newspaper is hosted on Newspapers.com. It requires a subscription to view, but they offer 7 days free access if you register).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, The first public use of the phrase &quot;&lt;em&gt;First World War&lt;/em&gt;&quot; seems to have been in the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/firstworldwar19100repi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;memoirs&lt;/a&gt; published in 1920, and the first public use of the phrase &quot;&lt;em&gt;World War 1&lt;/em&gt;&quot; appears to have been by &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601390612,00.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/a&gt; in June 1939. However, this still doesn't quite answer the question. In 1920, and even in 1939, the term &quot;&lt;em&gt;The Great War&lt;/em&gt;&quot; was still far more common in general use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, various people have done analyses to discover when the terms &quot;&lt;em&gt;First World War&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;em&gt;World War 1&lt;/em&gt;&quot; became more popular than &quot;&lt;em&gt;The Great War&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in general use. I wasn't able to find one that would stand up to rigorous academic scrutiny (sources of potential bias in the data are obvious in every example I found), but &lt;a href=&quot;http://discontents.com.au/when-did-the-great-war-become-the-first-world-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; does contain a nice interactive graph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion is that use of &quot;&lt;em&gt;First World War&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;em&gt;World War 1&lt;/em&gt;&quot; overtook the phrase &quot;&lt;em&gt;The Great War&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in general use in about 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the question is not as trivial as it first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is all fine and, if the question hadn't been closed as a duplicate, I might well have posted it as an answer.

He is correct, but OP is asking about fictional monarchies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would vote to close a question about inheritance laws in monarchies. Different monarchies have different laws/customs/traditions. Salic law applies to France, but not to England.  Inheritance law is different in Scotland than in England despite the fact that they share a monarch. In Belgium, the monarch must be Catholic, but in England that is illegal.  Some Saxon kingdoms permitted women to rule; some required that the new king share a lineage with the old king; other Saxon kingdoms forbid women to rule and permitted anyone who could muster the forces to &quot;inherit&quot;.  Polish kings were elected according to Eldridge Gerry. Paris was worth a Mass.  At the end of the Elizabethan period, it was a crime punishable by death to discuss inheritance of the crown.  Venetian Doges were elected by a multi-step process in order to guarantee that the process would be controlled by corruption and could never be completed without corruption.  There are no readily identifiable class of inheritance laws in monarchies any more than there are chore divisions in marriages.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, &quot;Monarchy&quot; is a form of government ( a class of similar, but not identical types of government.)  It doesn't really make sense to ask &quot;What is the law that binds the class of individuals who make laws?&quot;  Autocratic monarchs could set their own rules for inheritance, and could break them a year later (Henry II, IIRC)  Constitutional monarchs must adhere to their constitution (England after the Glorious Revolution).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is that if you're asking about history, you need to ask about the history of a specific monarchy at a specific time.

The likely result is that history is likely to get bent or twisted for the sake of the game. That is to say that the game might contain &quot;some&quot; elements that are suggested or inspired by &quot;history&quot; without coming close enough to the actual facts to the be accurate. The danger is that games, and questions based on games, are likely to introduce &quot;false facts.&quot; that &quot;pass&quot; as &quot;history,&quot; thereby misleading, rather than educating, players.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one game featured a boy who could look into the future and see that his potential career paths branched into 1) the &quot;King of England&quot; or 2) a &quot;scientist&quot; who was a disciple of Faraday.

If the evidence survived, I have no doubt that professional historians would expend almost as much ink on the subject as they have on the pet names used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OMP93v2i7qQC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Winston and Clementine Churchill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, the answer has to do with historiography, or perhaps &quot;how we know what we know about history&quot;. Simply put, the evidence of the letters from Clementine to Winston Churchill survive; the letters from Constanze to Mozart do not (as I pointed out in my answer). We know the pet names used for Mozart by his family, but not by his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should letters to Mozart from his wife ever turn up in an archive somewhere, I think we can be fairly certain that historians, both professional and amateur, will be interested in their contents, not least in how Constanze addresses her husband. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question relates to a (slightly ridiculous in my opinion) suggestion that Henry VIII of England required that the door to his chambers was bricked up each night.

Clearly, therefore, in this case the answer to the question &quot;&lt;em&gt;Would a professional historian be interested in the subject matter?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; is, simply, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24858" LastActivityDate="2017-09-06T08:18:37.630" CommentCount="0" />

Don't these people know how to use&#xA;  Google?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then two things gave me pause.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Firstly, it asks about &quot;&lt;em&gt;past policies&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (plural). As far as I know,&#xA;the visit went against his own previous policy (as expressed during&#xA;his 1964 visit to Asia). I wasn't aware of any other policy, and a&#xA;brief Google search didn't find any either.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The second point was that this was the first post by a new user.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I added a comment asking the OP to add a link to the article. I figured that would clarify the question. I also hoped that asking the OP to include a link to their source would encourage them to do so in future as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later (just &lt;em&gt;6 minutes&lt;/em&gt; after the question had been posted!) it got the first vote-to-close (surprisingly, perhaps, not because it's a request for trivia, but because of &quot;&lt;em&gt;Uncited source no evidence of research&lt;/em&gt;&quot;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, this was 2am, so I just posted the best answer I could and called it a night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The follwowing morning, the question had been closed (hardly a surprise, if I'm being honest), but the OP had added a link to the article. The article states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The shorthand is “Nixon goes to China,” meaning a moment in which a&#xA;  leader reverses his past positions to do something that is shocking&#xA;  but beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which, presumably, explains the plural &quot;&lt;em&gt;past policies&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, in this case the OP hasn't been put-off using History:SE by their experience, but a glance at the list of users suggests that others may have been. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second post was yesterday. It asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/40360/24858&quot;&gt;what made a region an &quot;upper&quot; or a &quot;lower&quot; region&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of writing, the question has 3 down-votes as a &quot;request for trivia&quot;. As originally posted, the question certainly showed that the OP had carried out some research:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There doesn't seem to be a correlation with altitude, relative&#xA;  orientation, or size. Maybe up or down river?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I imagine it's reminiscent of the Roman empire, but I'm uncertain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, personally, I would say that the question was trivial to answer, but then my father was a land surveyor, so I'm probably at an unfair advantage. On balance, I think I'd agree with T.E.D. and Tom's comments and say that it is a perfectly reasonable question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, Tom's comment about how to improve the question is an example of just the sort of thing that I think we should be doing more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this was a user who was new to History:SE. At the time of writing, they have made their opinions about the people who down-voted the question clear in the comments to the question. On the basis of that comment, I'd guess History:SE wouldn't be getting any 5-star reviews!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So should we be handling questions from new users better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the site stats, at the time of posting, we have 17,317 users. That sounds like an impressive number, but I'm a bit of a data nerd - I like to try and understand data trends. I took a look at the user lists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On 20 September 2017 there were 443 pages of users (each page displaying 36 users).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;162 pages of users have a reputation of 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;171 pages have a reputation of 101 (a majority of these are probably new&#xA;users who have the site association bonus).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which leaves just 110 pages, or 3960 users. That's not quite as impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Several pages of users have scores just below 100. I'd guess that a number of them joined the site with the association bonus and posted questions/answers that attracted down-votes. Without better data-analysis tools it would be too laborious to try to identify them, but it is worth remembering that the figure of 3960 is probably a slight over-estimate].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm sure that many of the users with a reputation of 1 or 101 have joined the site out of interest, and just haven't had a particular question to ask, or answer to give. Others have probably just joined to answer a specific post that they came across as a HNQ or that came up in the results of a Google search. Nevertheless, these figures do make me wonder if we are intimidating new users away from the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, don't misunderstand me. I think that poor-quality questions should either be improved or deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Had the first question above been posted by a user with a rep of 501, or even 201, I'd have said that the comments, down-votes, and votes-to-close were entirely justified. But shouldn't new users be given a chance to learn what's expected of them before their question is deleted?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it looks like a request for trivia, post a comment and ask them if&#xA;they've looked on Wikipedia or Google. Ask them what their research&#xA;has found so far.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If they haven't quoted their source, maybe we should just ask for it&#xA;in a comment?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps we should direct them to the Site Tour and the Help Centre?&#xA;Especially if they look to be very new to SE.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, shouldn't we give them something more than 6 minutes before we vote to close their questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24858" LastActivityDate="2017-10-11T02:33:00.833" Title="Are we sufficiently supportive towards new users?"

I wouldn't feel comfortable closing/deleting it due to the high number of votes and the vintage, but if asked today I highly suspect it would be closed (and deleted).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Convert an answer to a comment (answer only). I don't like to do this if the poster didn't have the rep to create a comment themselves, because the moderation system should not be (ab)used as a way to get around the reputation limits on commenting. It should also be a comment of at least some value.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Migrate an otherwise good off-topic question to another SE site where it should be on-topic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things normal users such as yourself can (and should) do, once they gain the required reputation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vote on questions and answers.

I'm one of the culprits and I'm trying to shift my responses, but I get so very very tired of people asking me to look things up for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do my best to avoid hammering English as a Foreign Language speakers - if the grammar/spelling/phrasing indicates that the individual is not a native English speaker, I try to edit rather than downvote.

I hope this gives more time for potential fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need the periodic reminder that the reason we close questions is to fix them.  (or so I understand).  I wonder if there is a way to search for recently closed questions and try to salvage them.  (there probably is and I'm just not awake enough to spot it. )  I think that most of the questions are salvageable - if OP doesn't check google, there is no amount of editing that will make the question non-trivial.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried to offer the trivial answer to the trivial question - if the question can be answered through searching Wikipedia for the primary noun, then just offer a one sentence answer linking to the Wikipedia page.   I avoid VtC on any question with an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the ultimate answer is to implement what has been discussed before; a convention that all questions must include a summary of the prior research. Much of the problem is that the questions are trivial and the system is working.  Questions on programming languages or math or project management are inherently practical.   OP asks a question to solve a problem.  H:SE questions are not (usually) practical, they are founded in curiosity.  There is a larger proportion of the questions that should be closed because they are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;per se trivial - answered by google or wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beer &amp;amp; Pretzels questions - suitable for pub discussion, but not for serious historical research or thought&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book length (most questions that begin &quot;Why...&quot; or &quot;why not...&quot; - Causality is not simple. History doesn't consist of X because Y.  Usually any historical event has dozens of interaction precursors, factors, causes, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fully support your fundamental thesis - that we (including me) need to be more welcoming to those pages of users.  But the quality of questions is already pretty low.  We need to simultaneously (1) discourage bad questions, and (2) encourage novice querents. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RE: Wikipedia is not infallible; I'm not going to argue this point, but a strategy of permitting questions on the basis that Wikipedia might be wrong will certainly transform this site into a cesspool of trivial mediocrity.  If someone asks, &quot;Wikipedia provides a birthdate for A. Hamilton that contradicts this source and that source, how do I determine which is correct?&quot; that question is ipso facto not trivial.  It demonstrates research and cannot be answered by Wikipedia.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Help] says we don't want to replace Wikipedia.  Neither are we the corrections bureau- Wikipedia has a process for quality control and I would vigorously oppose substituting H:SE for that process.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If people want to oppose Wikipedia, that is fine, but what is the solution? what is the definition of a trivial question?

For the record, I do not argue this point; I acknowledge that such cases exist.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My problem is one of relative weight.  I think trivial questions are toxic to H:SE.  H:SE relies on people practicing a fairly advanced skillset to do research on behalf of our querents. To me, the greatest danger is that we'll lose our experts because they don't want to spend their time doing a copy and paste from Wikipedia and google.  I think we should permit the use of LMGTFY, although I respect the communal decision to forbid that tool.  I come here to exercise my brain and my research skills, and every time I find another series of &quot;what is 2+2?&quot;, or &quot;What was G Washington's first name?&quot;, my enthusiasm diminishes - this is a waste of time.  This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/broken-windows-theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;broken window theory&lt;/a&gt;.  Trivial questions send a signal to the members that the participants of this SE are content with copy and paste, and are correspondingly less likely to provide content that is educational.  Bad questions communicate something very clearly about the quality and depth of the forum.  I believe that there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gresham's Law&lt;/a&gt; of questions - bad questions drive out good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;@NeMo has challenged whether I understand his point - I think I do, but  I have different priorities/preferences, and while I acknowledge the truth of his point, I think that it is less important than the danger of trivial questions.  (I've provided a somewhat longwinded example below) The point is that there is a class of questions where consultation of Wikipedia will result in an erroneous answer.  The core question is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are such questions trivial?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, @NeMo says that such questions are not trivial because the interpretation requires some skill and subtlety (perhaps my example wasn't as far off base as I first thought).  Let me repeat again, I'm not saying that @NeMo is wrong.  If I've said anything that indicates disrespect for @NeMo's position or person, I'll revise it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I disagree with him even though he may be right.  I once heard an MBA assert that everything in reality can be broken down to a 2x2 matrix.  In this case, the axis are &quot;frequency&quot; and &quot;Importance&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that trivial questions are a frequent and important stain on H:SE - I occupy the Upper Left quadrant of that matrix - Frequency High, Importance High.  In my opinion, questions that appear trivial but are actually complex are in lower half of the graph, probably midway between the two quadrants.  They are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; infrequent and of middling importance.  Because I assign the weights this way, I think that @NeMo's concern is valid, but not actionable, while the trivial question problem is an existential threat to H:SE. I suspect that @NeMo might assign different weights to the two axis - I'm not going to put words in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a second point - how easily can we recover from the two dangers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trivial questions need to be closed, closed fast and closed hard.  The quality of the site relies on having interesting questions at the top front. We could just do the copy/paste exercise, but is anyone seriously going to participate in a forum full of questions of the form, &quot;What is G. Washington's first name?&quot;  Are you going to want to participate with people who do want to engage with that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;there is a simple way to recover from Misleading Wikipedia questions.  Let's take the worst case - someone asked a question that is closed because it appears trivial, but it is not trivial.  In such a case, anyone spotting the problem can revise the problem to point out the ambiguity.  &quot;I see Hamilton born in this year here and in that year on Wikipedia - which is correct?&quot; or &quot;I don't understand the answers that Wikipedia provided to 'who is buried in Grant's tomb'&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Aside: an example&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as an example, &quot;What color was Washington's white horse?&quot;   (turns out it isn't as good an example as I thought, because Wikipedia does not provide the expected answer, but it does provide an array of partial answers which are all wrong.  )  Wikipedia provides&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_white&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dominant White&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and under &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse#Colors_and_markings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt; there is a section that hints at the correct answer, but fails to actually provide the answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white disambiguation page provides a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_(horse)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;White(horse)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(as documented elsewhere, my normal standard is that if the answer isn't clear in the first five responses, then the question is not trivial).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my summary of @NeMo's point is that the question &quot;What color is Washington's White horse?&quot; is not, in fact trivial, because none of the answers found on Wikipedia will clearly state that the answer is &quot;Gray&quot; - because according to breeders, &quot;Gray&quot; is  the color name, and &quot;white&quot; is a variant. (this is an example, please don't argue the example - it is a distraction from @NeMo's point.)   If I spent more time I could find another example - As I recall, the date of Alexander Hamilton's birthday is frequently wrong on Wikipedia (in part because the true date is not known; Wikipedia isn't very good at discussing the unknown).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note:  While this question &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be redundant with this question on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/756/1401&quot;&gt;criteria for a trivial question&lt;/a&gt;, I'd like to explicitly examine the discussion that @NeMo and I have had in response to the question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3530/1401&quot;&gt;support for new users&lt;/a&gt;.

I don't doubt that you are right about broken window theory in that regard.

But I also think that - in the case of new users - we should take the time to explain why trivial questions are off-topic. At the very least, before closing a question we should post a comment with a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask&quot;&gt;How to Ask&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect that everyone wants to improve the quality of questions (and answers), but I think we also want to encourage new users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen a lot of close-votes coming up in review recently where I would have liked to vote &quot;&lt;em&gt;Not yet!&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. I don't know exactly how long we should wait for a new user to respond to comments / criticism before closing a question, but I do feel it should probably be measured in hours, rather than minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[As an aside, I'm becoming increasingly of the opinion that we should probably require that users are registered before being allowed to post on the site. I've noticed that, at least over the past few weeks, a significant percentage of trivial questions (and most of the low-quality answers) have been posted by unregistered users. Yannis mentioned that this might be possible in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/40210587#40210587&quot;&gt;discussion on chat&lt;/a&gt;. There are certainly pros and cons to preventing unregistered users from posting, and many of these have been pointed out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/243712/post-as-guest-is-a-bad-user-experience-and-encourages-low-quality-contribution&quot;&gt;SE:Meta&lt;/a&gt;. I may post separately about that to start a discussion.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, I think that defining a &quot;trivial question&quot; is going to be a non-trivial problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It almost goes without saying that every problem is trivial if you already know the answer. However, sometimes you need to have quite specific knowledge in order to frame the question, as with &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/39729/when-the-british-left-india-who-authorized-standstill-agreements-between-karnat&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; about the standstill agreements between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In those cases, if you have that knowledge then the question is, indeed, trivial. Otherwise, it can be really difficult to find the answer. I would argue that questions of this type should actually be encouraged, provided that they are otherwise on-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, of course questions like &quot;What was G Washington's first name?&quot; are going to be caught by any reasonable test for trivia. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that your answer to the linked question &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/756/what-are-the-criteria-for-a-trivial-question&quot;&gt;What are the criteria for a “trivial” question?&lt;/a&gt; could provide a useful basis for a &quot;trivia-test&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If I'm not sure whether a question is trivial, I copy the question,&#xA;  paste it into Google and look at the first five answers. If that&#xA;  amount of research reveals an answer, then the question is quite&#xA;  probably trivial. It suggests that OP didn't do any real research&#xA;  before posting the question.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I'd expand this to include &quot;&lt;em&gt;multiple mutually-corroborative answers, that aren't all copy-pasted versions of the same Wikipedia article!&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, but I think you've given us a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm less convinced by the argument that if we get it wrong, and close a question that wasn't trivial, we can always re-open it. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3500/24858&quot;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; in getting a question that was incorrectly closed re-opened hasn't exactly filled me with confidence in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of that, I think that I may be more inclined to caution when it comes to closing questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the particular case of questions that can be simply answered by reading Wikipedia articles, if I'm not already familiar with he subject matter, I'll try checking the references in the article and also searching other sites for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I think that if consulting Wikipedia alone would result in an erroneous answer, and if providing an accurate answer here &quot;requires some skill and subtlety&quot;, then @NeMo is absolutely right. The question is not as trivial as it may have initially appeared, and - perhaps more importantly - we are not merely duplicating information that already exists on Wikipedia. In such cases, I think the question is probably on-topic and should not be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, you've been using the site a lot longer than I have, and you've therefore had longer to form your opinion.

A plate is flat and wide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On a modern brooch, &quot;bow&quot; can also refer to a ribbon (or representation of a &#xA;ribbon) shaped into a bow, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.noths-static.com/system/product_images/images/001/162/480/original_vintage-style-bow-brooch.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. Don't assume that non-archaeologists will use the same terminology as archaeologists.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In an archaeological context, a fitting is normally functional (like&#xA;a handle, for example) while a furniture mount is more decorative&#xA;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1OxGkOXXXXXXlXpXXq6xXFXXXl/4Pcs-30mm-font-b-Brass-b-font-Furniture-font-b-Corner-b-font-font-b-Brackets.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;corner brackets&lt;/a&gt; might be an example).

While it is trivial for me to answer, it might not be for someone who doesn't know to search for &quot;fibula&quot; in the context of a brooch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the second might be considered off-topic, but then we are back to the question of do people know what a &quot;fibula&quot; is in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would certainly argue that the third question was on-topic. The specific use of the terms in archaeology - and by extension in historical articles and journals - differs from common modern usage. Provided that it made explicit reference to an historical or archaeological context (e.g. the UK Portable Antiquities Scheme), I think that this would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;on-topic&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To clarify my answer to the third question above (since the comments below seem to indicate some confusion) consider the example of an escutcheon plate on a lock:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PyHqw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;simple escutcheon&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The function of an escutcheon plate is obvious - it protects the wood around a keyhole from damage when keys are repeatedly entered and removed from the keyhole. They are particularly associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warded_lock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;warded locks&lt;/a&gt; and examples have been found in contexts from Ancient Rome and Ancient China. In its simplest form it is just a disk or rectangle of metal with a hole of appropriate size and shape cut into it. Most of us would consider this to be a &quot;furniture fitting&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I suspect that most of us have also seen much more elaborate escutcheon plates, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/4eDfv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;elaborate escutcheon&quot;&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This still performs the function of an escutcheon plate, but is also now a decorative item. Is it now a &quot;furniture fitting&quot;, or a &quot;furniture mount&quot;? Where should we draw the line?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no hard-and-fast rule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are just labels used by archaeologists to describe groups of artefacts.&lt;/strong&gt; Hopefully all the archaeologists working for a particular unit will be consistent (if that unit actually has guidance that specific!). Failing that, we might hope that each archaeologist would use the terms consistently. When we start talking about archaeologists working in different countries, all bets are off ...!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern furniture makers are somewhat indiscriminate in their use of the terms (which, I suspect, was the root of the problem when you asked that question on DIY:SE).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24858" LastEditorUserId="24858" LastEditDate="2017-10-14T19:43:51.327" LastActivityDate="2017-10-14T19:43:51.327" CommentCount="0" />

The answer here is actually straightforward. A &lt;em&gt;Lingua Franca&lt;/em&gt; is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/u7oQW.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lingua Franca - OED&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Arabic was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; in the Middle Ages, but not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a Wikipedia page on the subject, which includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lingua_francas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;List of lingua francas&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I get from your question that you aren't a big fan of Wikipedia. However, the Help Centre makes it clear that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Requests for trivia or basic historical facts are off-topic if they can be easily answered by looking up the relevant topic on Wikipedia. We're trying to complement common historical references, not duplicate them.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I've only been using this site for about 6 months, so I wasn't involved in drawing up the rules. However, this is one that I agree with completely. (I do wish that it was applied correctly though. Too often, questions are closed for being trivial when they cannot, in fact, be easily answered with a simple Google search or by looking up the relevant topic on Wikipedia. However, that is a different question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you believe that the relevant entry on Wikipedia is wrong, incomplete, or misleading (which it may well be) then you need to show that in your question. Ideally, that point should be supported by sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this was pointed out to you in the comments, together with the suggestion that you should edit your question so that it fit with the guidelines. You declined to do so, and the question was closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your next question was &lt;a href=&quot;http://What%20is%20the%20most%20historic%20hotel%20in%20the%20United%20States?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;What is the most historic hotel in the United States?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The obvious question to ask here was &quot;How do you quantify &lt;em&gt;most historic&lt;/em&gt;&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You haven't provided any criteria to measure against, so any answer will be based on opinion. Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing in general, and might be a great question for a debate on &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1560/the-time-machine&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;, but it is once again expressly off-topic according to the guidelines in the Help Centre:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;avoid asking subjective questions where ... every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, not all subjective questions are considered to be off-topic.

Once again, you declined to do so, and once again the question was closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree that one must be cautious about using Wikipedia.

A few examples are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1772943&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;On measuring the quality of Wikipedia articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822293&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Assigning trust to Wikipedia content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4782868/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;A Brief Review of Studies of Wikipedia in Peer-Reviewed Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(These particular examples are all behind paywalls, but I'm sure that a Google search will turn up other, similar, articles which will doubtless make the same points)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am generally quite relaxed about using it to provide links to the pages for people mentioned in my answers, since this is mainly to provide background detail for people unfamiliar with the subject or person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in my answer to the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39934/24858&quot;&gt;Why did the Germans spare Allied troops trapped at Dunkirk?&lt;/a&gt;, I've tried to link to all the Wikipedia pages for the individuals mentioned in my answer. These are not essential details, but simply background information to help those unfamiliar with the &lt;em&gt;dramatis personae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also generally happy to provide links to Wikipedia for uncontentious topics, although with a note of caution that you didn't mention. While the URL to the Wikipedia page shouldn't change, the content of that page might. Almost anyone can edit Wikipedia - it is, in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;... written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might link to a page with content that is uncontentious, and which provides the mainstream view about a topic, a future edit may change that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for things like the British Expeditionary Force, and the background to the Dunkirk evacuation itself which I also mentioned in my answer above the Wikipedia pages again provide useful background for those less-familiar with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, for the documents that provide the main sources for my answer (the diaries of General Halder, the note from Major-General Alfred Jodl to labour minister Robert Ley, etc.) I prefer to link to online, digitised versions of the original documents where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, Wikipedia is getting better at providing sources for its content, but it is a slow process (see the reviews in the academic journals listed above). Wikipedia is still no substitute for proper peer-reviewed sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of the journals containing those sources are now only available online behind a paywall. I was challenged about this when I provided links to this type of site in some of my early answers (I pay for access to the relevant sites because I need them for research).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That seems to me to be a reasonable complaint. The point of linking to the source is to support the assertions we make in our questions and answers. If others can't read those sources, then how do they know we are quoting them correctly? How can they follow up on the answer and take their research further? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also clearly going to be extremely frustrating to have to search for alternatives (as you may have now experienced yourself in the case of the journal articles I cited above)!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On other questions, I have used books from my own 'library' as the source for my answer. I'm lucky in that regard. I own quite a lot of books. Unfortunately, while books are wonderful things, they can be difficult to share online. Often, those books are also available on Google Books, but Sods-Law dictates that the preview doesn't include the relevant pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have often spent longer looking for decent online sources to support the points in my answer than I spent on writing the answer itself. [If anyone is interested, I've found archive.org to be a very useful resource in that regard. In particular, they have a complete series of the Congressional Record which is obviously &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; go-to source for a lot of American political history].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, yes, in the final analysis, sometimes it is just easier to quote Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the article there is well written (many articles are, despite the criticism you make), and if the [current] content appears to be correct, then I'm reasonable happy to include it as a link in my answer. I would argue that is generally better than providing no supporting source at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least then others can review my source, and challenge it if they feel that it it wrong (hopefully they would also provide alternative sources to support their position). And surely that is, in fact, the main reason for providing supporting sources in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24858" LastEditorUserId="24858" LastEditDate="2017-11-24T10:25:15.107" LastActivityDate="2017-11-24T10:25:15.107" CommentCount="1" />

In some cases, a comment will begin a non-productive back and forth exchange, which degrades site quality by increasing noise with no added signal.  In other cases, a comment will result in what comments are built for: improving the question or answer in play.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each person down voting needs to apply their judgment on what they think will be the outcome of a comment for a given question or answer.  Give the users some credit, eh?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;This SE site, and any other SE site, Isn't A Discussion Forum.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What that means is that if the answerer or asker does not meet the minimum quality standard outlined in the Help Center, the system is built to provide negative feedback.  While stated in a variety of more flowery terms (see Be Nice rules), the message that needs to be sent clearly is &quot;No, your input isn't good enough, raise your game.&quot;  A favorable signal to noise ratio requires that kind of feedback to get the quality content the SE system desires.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's the rest of the internet to make noise: at an SE site, signal is valued. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/06/13/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/&quot;&gt;Optimizing for Pearls, not Sand&lt;/a&gt;&quot; at the home site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/809/16773&quot;&gt;reading Shog9's answer here&lt;/a&gt; on a very similar discussion from early in the site's beta period.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16773" LastEditorUserId="16773" LastEditDate="2017-12-04T18:09:04.960" LastActivityDate="2017-12-04T18:09:04.960" CommentCount="0" />

(1) the number of applicable questions is very low: there's really just a couple. (2) you can basically get the same result just by searching for Schleswig and Holstein. (3) For most of history Shleswig and Holstein were separate duchies and there's not much reason to consider them jointly except for one topic, namely the Schleswig-Holstein Question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags are very helpful in unifying multiple search terms. For example, a WW2 question may only refer to a date, or say &quot;WW2&quot;, or &quot;Second World War&quot;, or just say &quot;Hitler / Nazi Germany&quot;. With the popularity of WW2 questions, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/second-world-war&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;second-world-war&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;second-world-war&lt;/a&gt; tag is very convenient because it helps bring all of these under one search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Schleswig-Holstein, it seems rather more convenient to simply search for the region by name. It is almost unavoidable that any such question will mention the area's name. Combined with a low number of questions, the utility of this tag becomes reduced. And in fact the modern German state of Schleswig-Holstein is mostly just Holstein anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real problem is that &lt;strong&gt;questions are limited to only five tags&lt;/strong&gt;. The example question in the OP had already hit this limit with &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nazi-germany&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;nazi-germany&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;nazi-germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/world-war-one&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;world-war-one&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;world-war-one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hitler&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hitler&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hitler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/denmark&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;denmark&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;denmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/border-dispute&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;border-dispute&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;border-dispute&lt;/a&gt;.

Instead of doing one search to find all [x] question, one would have to search twice. Of course this isn't always a bad thing.

If they were to share this knowledge, then we'll either get partial answers in the comments, or incomplete answers as a reply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it's not rare to see questions that are misinformed or confused about certain critical details. Often a quick clarification could assist the asker in identifying the real question of interest. Again, this could be a partial answer in the comments that clears up a specific part of the question, or an incomplete answer that may easily be rendered irrelvant if the asker were to edit their question to improve its quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the choices, I believe comments are superior because they don't clutter the thread with partial answers. It takes less time and effort, and doesn't come with the risk of being penalised with downvotes, therefore we encourage more participation and exchange of information. Lastly, and this is where the ephemeral nature of comments come in handy - these can be deleted without much impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an addendum, I would suggest that discussion comment chains should generally be moved into chat with a corresponding link left in the comments, rather than deleted completely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another scenario is trivial questions, which H.SE maintains a policy of closing. It's often easy to explain why such questions should be closed by answering it, which I believe is superior to leaving the asker in the dark. These &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be posted as full answers, but in the common case where the answer is a Wikipedia article, the standing consensus is that we do not want to duplicate Wikipedia, but also that link only answers are not allowed.

So there is some inherent imprecision.  When the closure reason doesn't seem to match the facts, we have to look deeper to figure out why people voted to close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, I think your question is legitimate. I'm going to re-read the question and the comments and the answers before I act, and I may wait and listen to some other people's opinions, but prima facia, I think it is a legit question.  Having said that, this may also be a case where closure provides an opportunity to revise a question and re-open it to everyone's benefit.  There are a couple of anti-patterns in your question that are detracting from the evaluation of the question.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the largest contributor to the problem was the misunderstanding of how you were defining &quot;largest&quot;.  You clarified this in the edit, but I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; that some damage had already been done.   Before a vote to re-open, I recommend that you move that edit from a postscript to the first sentence.  I think if we make that explicit we will resolve much of the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;well researched&quot; - Reviewing the entire issue, it is clear to me that you have researched this question and that you know your stuff.  Reading the question alone, that is less clear.  I think if the clarifications in the comments had been edited into the question, everyone would agree that it is well researched. But I also believe that the requests for clarification in the comments were legitimate.  The first draft of the question didn't make it clear that you were asking about land area.  It wasn't clear that you were talking about the Iberian Empire rather than the Spanish Empire.  I think that if you edit the question as @LangLangC requested, it will resolve the problem.  Define &quot;largest&quot;, define &quot;Iberian Empire&quot; (and link to a reference), define the time period to which you refer.  You've done most of this in comments, but if it is moved to the question and organized, I think the problem will be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone offers a Wikipedia page in the comments, the question is very likely to be closed as trivial.  That indicates that we, the community, don't understand why the Wikipedia page doesn't answer the question.  I think if you can provide that information in the question in a somewhat more neutral tone than is currently in the comments, the problem will be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;I'm asking this question because it seems to me that the Iberian Empire, under Phillip II, a Habsburg, was far larger.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - very closely fits the &quot;I think X amiright?&quot; anti-pattern from the help center.  Those anti-patterns in the help center record the community experience over time, and questions that are similar to those anti-patterns are going to inherit some community qualms - there is subconcious &quot;what, this sounds like all those questions that...&quot;  In this case, this question &lt;em&gt;resembles&lt;/em&gt; questions that are argumentative and trivial.  People are very good at pattern recognition - even when the pattern is a false one - and subjectively will begin to react to the pattern.   I think that some minor editing to the word choices in the question will convey much more effectively that you are looking for an objective answer based on an objective measurement.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of the word &quot;seems&quot; reinforces the impression of subjectivity.  I think I get why you chose that word, but I also think I get why other people were uncomfortable.  Again, minor editing will eliminate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to be argumentative, but I do want to provide feedback - I will admit that when I personally read the question, I was tempted to hit the trivial button because &quot;largest land mass&quot; seems like a trivial measurement to me.  There are infinite numbers of ways to measure an empire - some are standard (GDP), and some are positively silly (number of left handed blue eyed people named &quot;lars&quot;).  &quot;largest land mass&quot; doesn't seem to help me to understand Empires or Imperialism, or anything else.  I am not saying it is illegitimate, but it reinforces the other impressions of that sentence.  If you can explain why this measurement matters it will help; if not, I think that resolving the other problems will address this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple argumentative comments. Based on years of participation in the site, I have observed that when OP's comments are argumentative, the question is in trouble. Comments are (usually/supposed to be) requests for clarification. When OP responds in comments, things devolve into arguments and tit for tat, and nobody gets any joy. I advise OP's not to respond in comments, but to edit the question.   I believe that if you edit the question to incorporate the substantive points in the comments, and I purge the comments, this problem will vanish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;missed opportunity.  In the comment stream you say, &quot;f you consider Spanish possessions in South America, Brazil, and The Viceroyalty of New Spain together, there was a time when the Iberian Empire covered an area of perhaps 34.000.000 km² in the Americas alone&quot; - If you edit that into the question, this will be resoved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think there is a single, clear empirical reason why the question was closed. I think it was a combination of factors.  I've tried to indicated how those factors could be resolved.  I think the fundamental question is legitimate, and could be edited into re-open fairly easily. It is early and I haven't had enough caffeine yet today; if I've misunderstood the problem, please let me know.  I think I speak for all of us in affirming that we do want to welcome new members, particularly those who have researched and thought through the problem deeply before asking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastActivityDate="2017-12-24T14:02:30.777" CommentCount="2" />

As soon as you have to expand the editor box things get ugly fast. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are long answers bad?

(Is there a general guideline or recent discussion I overlooked on how to orient yourself, lengthwise in an answer?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, on a site that benefits from at least slightly longer answers, the default browser edit-field is way too small to fit just three proper paragraphs into it. As soon as the editor/writer has to scroll, keeping an eye on structure and layout is simply terrible. If it would at least live-render in side by side mode. Way to many of my edits are because I overlooked something basic, lost orientation in my own text or just wanted to prevent loosing the text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Offline composing with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; editor available that live-renders markdown and only posting the final result when all links and pictures and any formatting quirks are dealt with seems like a better way to go. If it isn't, please correct me. For example if I overlooked a browser configuration or extension?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've looked into &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; editors that run on Apple hardware – I also searched for software that does a tiny bit of of what I am asking here before – (also in questions on this SE).

It's a somewhat complicated topic though, and sure to generate many conflicting opinions. The two main issues as I see them are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain&lt;/strong&gt; is an ambiguous term that can mean Great Britain the island, or the United Kingdom, or the Kingdom of Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great Britain&lt;/strong&gt; is ambiguous term that can mean either the island or the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/tagging&quot;&gt;The purpose of tags is to sort questions into useful categories.&lt;/a&gt;. This means that tags should strike a balance &lt;strong&gt;between specificity and generality&lt;/strong&gt;, and ideally be relatively unambiguous and intuitive to use. While editing the excerpts can help, the reality is that most people don't bother reading them. Case in point, right now &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;britain&lt;/a&gt; contains questions including the Kingdom of Great Britain, the United Kingdom, the British Empire, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the island of Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my proposal is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create a new tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;british-isles&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;british-isles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This has the great advantage of being an unambiguously geographical and well understood term, unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;great-britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;great-britain&lt;/a&gt; which is both an island and a kingdom. The British Isles taken as a whole is also reasonably sized for a general regional tag, since we already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ireland&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ireland&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scotland&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scotland&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wales&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;wales&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;wales&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/england&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;england&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;england&lt;/a&gt; for more specific questions. &lt;sub&gt;If people are adamantly opposed to grouping Ireland together with the UK, an alternative is &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-islands&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;british-islands&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;british-islands&lt;/a&gt; which exclude Ireland. But in my opinion this is unnecessarily specific.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;britain&lt;/a&gt; a &quot;synonym&quot; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;united-kingdom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;united-kingdom&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Because Britain is an ambiguous term with conflicting definitions, it is better to avoid it altogether. I believe the redirect is appropriate because Britain is a common abbreviation for the UK, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/33989/what-percentage-of-british-people-during-the-industrial-revolution-were-rich&quot;&gt;many&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/37732/how-did-the-british-army-unit-size-and-structure-in-wwi-change-from-1915-to-1918&quot;&gt;existing&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/34579/what-does-georgius-iii-dg-britanniarum-rex-fidei-def-c-mean&quot;&gt;questions&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; use the tag that way anyway. We can include usage notes in the tag redirecting people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;british-isles&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;british-isles&lt;/a&gt; or another appropriate tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question is what to do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;great-britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;great-britain&lt;/a&gt;. We could maintain it as a separate tag for the Kingdom of Great Britain, which is, in theory, the existing usage. In practice, it is frequently misused in confusion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;united-kingdom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;united-kingdom&lt;/a&gt; - see below for examples. Evidently this tag is non intuitive for our users, and I would further argue that it is unnecessarily fragmentary. Therefore, my proposal is to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;declare &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;united-kingdom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;united-kingdom&lt;/a&gt; the appropriate tag for the Kingdom of Great Britain:&lt;/strong&gt; They are the same polity with an unbroken continuity, separated only by a cosmetic name change. Hence, practically speaking, there's no real benefit to treating them separately. In fact, most of our users don't: &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42470/what-were-the-motivating-factors-in-the-scottish-highland-clearances&quot;&gt;many&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/40515/why-was-prince-philip-given-these-specific-titles-before-marrying-princess-eliza&quot;&gt;existing&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/36132/what-is-the-greater-significance-of-the-boer-war&quot;&gt;questions&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;great-britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;great-britain&lt;/a&gt; are actually about the UK, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom+18th-century&quot;&gt;vice versa&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Kingdom of Great Britain almost completely overlaps with the 18th century, I propose we simply tag such questions &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/18th-century&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;18th-century&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;18th-century&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;united-kingdom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;united-kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;great-britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;great-britain&lt;/a&gt; a synonym for &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;united-kingdom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;united-kingdom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;british-isles&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;british-isles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4935" LastEditorUserId="4935" LastEditDate="2018-01-18T19:16:46.717" LastActivityDate="2018-01-18T19:16:46.717" CommentCount="14" />

It includes the Isle of Wight, the Hebrides, Orkneys, Shetlands, Anglesey, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While negligible in size, the culture of these places is very strong, and diverse both with regard to other and to Britain (England, Scotland and Wales are obviously hetrogenous too, but that's another story).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, a question could be about &lt;em&gt;Great Britain&lt;/em&gt;, but not &lt;em&gt;Britain&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, any question can't be about &lt;em&gt;Great Britain&lt;/em&gt; if it deals with events before the 18th century; the Romans, Saxons, Normans etc settled &lt;em&gt;Britain&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Great Britain&lt;/em&gt; didn't exist yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Division should be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;British Isles&lt;/strong&gt;: the whole shebang.

As such, we should probably be careful of removing tags which help to find information. The numbers of questions may be relatively small now, but they will hopefully grow as the site grows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the problem is not a straightforward one, and is complicated by history, geography and politics. The language matters to a lot of people (note the history of nationalism in Ireland, Scotland and Wales!) The following diagram will give some illustration of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/DgmZ9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Britain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And even that does not capture the full complexity! I hope that I don't tread on too may toes in what follows. If I do, I can only apologise and hope that I have only trodden lightly!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there are logically two ways to look at this if we are going to decide what tags are likely to be needed to capture this complexity: &lt;em&gt;top-down&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bottom-up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try a &lt;em&gt;bottom-up&lt;/em&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In its modern sense, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Britain&lt;/em&gt;&quot; is a rather nebulous, often ill-defined term. However, when that term is used the component parts that go to make up the whole will probably be some, or all, of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/england&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;england&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;england&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ireland&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ireland&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scotland&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scotland&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wales&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Isle of Man&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Channel Islands (Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, Sark, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When James VI and I succeeded to the throne of England on the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, he had three separate and distinct crowns: the crown of England, the crown of Scotland and the crown of Ireland. The term &lt;em&gt;Great Britain&lt;/em&gt; was actually first used during the reign of James VI &amp;amp; I as a kind of shorthand to refer to the (then still separate) Kingdoms of England and Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kingdom of Great Britain was created by the union of the crowns of Scotland and England. The name was defined in the first sections of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ann/6/11/part/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Union with Scotland Act 1706&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1707/7/section/I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Union with England Act 1707&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ann/6/11/contents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1706 Act&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland shall upon the First day of May which shall be in the year One thousand seven hundred and seven and for ever after be united into one Kingdom by the name of Great Britain&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which left two kingdoms: the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a side-note, Wales had been conquered and occupied by Edward I in the 13th century, and was effectively a colony of England until it was formally annexed through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535_and_1542&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Laws in Wales Acts 1535 &amp;amp; 1542&lt;/a&gt;, which made it a part of the Kingdom of England. This is also why there is no &quot;Welsh&quot; component in the union flag:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ87m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;union flag&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and may also explain why we have relatively few questions explicitly about Wales so far, and don't (yet) have a tag for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1800, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Geo3/39-40/67&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Union with Ireland Act&lt;/a&gt; united the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The act states that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;the said kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall, upon the first day of January which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and one, and for ever after, be united into one kingdom, by the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The name was amended to the &lt;em&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&lt;/em&gt; when southern Ireland became independent of the UK from 1922.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;So, what I suggest is the following:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the basis of the history set out above, I think it makes sense to retain the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;great-britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;great-britain&lt;/a&gt; to refer explicitly to events involving the Kingdom of Great Britain, and to create a usage excerpt and summary to reflect that. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;britain&lt;/a&gt; tag really does not mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;united-kingdom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;united-kingdom&lt;/a&gt; should be used to refer to the &lt;em&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/em&gt; (from 1800 - 1922) and/or the &lt;em&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&lt;/em&gt; (from 1922 - ). The usage excerpt and summary for the tag should be updated to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which still leaves us with a couple of problems. The first of these may be illustrated by a couple of examples. How should we tag questions that are explicitly about Roman Britain (distinct from the rest of the Roman Empire), or about post-Roman Britain before the emergence of an entity that was recognisably &quot;England&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is in situations like this where the less-precise term &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;britain&lt;/a&gt; may be useful. However, it is probably better to use the unambiguous &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;british-isles&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;british-isles&lt;/a&gt;, with an appropriate usage excerpt and summary to make it clear that the function of the tag is a &quot;catch-all&quot;. We can then maintain &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;britain&lt;/a&gt;  as a synonym for &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;british-isles&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;british-isles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at the list of questions tagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;britain&lt;/a&gt; shows a number that should probably be re-tagged as either &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;great-britain&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;great-britain&lt;/a&gt;, (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/40609/why-were-british-ships-not-of-the-same-quality-as-french-and-spanish-ships-until&quot;&gt;Why were British ships not of the same quality as French and Spanish ships until the latter part of the 18th century?&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;united-kingdom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;united-kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/39308/how-did-the-crimean-war-change-british-society&quot;&gt;How did the Crimean war change British society?&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other problem is Ireland.

This is just not true, but I could not respond at the time given the question was closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The facts are there were 7 times the United States Gov publicly addressed this attack.  3 of them were investigatory bodies.  But none of those investigatory bodies dealt with the scope of Israeli findings for the attack. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigative Reports highlighted below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Paraphrased From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia: USS Liberty incident see US Gov Investigations of Attack.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  * &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry of June 1967&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Scope limited to US Navy personnel actions before, during and after the attack.   &quot;It was not the responsibility of the court to rule on the culpability of the attackers, and no evidence was heard from the attacking nation&quot;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  * &lt;strong&gt;Joint Chief of Staff's Report of June&lt;/strong&gt; 1967.  Scope limited to Communications failures within the US Navy surrounding the attack.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  * CIA Intelligence Memorandums of June 1967.  Two memo's one laying out sources of information, the other detailing the Israeli courts findings.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  * Clark Clifford Report of July 1967 - says after reviewing all available information, &quot;The unprovoked attack on the Liberty constitutes a flagrant act of gross negligence for which the Israeli Government should be held completely responsible, and the Israeli military personnel involved should be punished.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  * Senate Foreign Relations Committee Testimony during hearings of the  1967 Foreign Aid Authorization bill, July 1967.  Comments about the attack while the Senate was dealing with other business.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  * House Armed Services Committee Investigation of 1971 -  &quot;Review of Department of Defense Worldwide Communications&quot;. Was not an investigation on the attack. Contained a section describing communications during the attack.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  * &lt;strong&gt;The NSA History Report&lt;/strong&gt; of 1981 - reviews the court of inquiry and several other documents but provides no conclusion regarding culpability.              &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Wording of My Question:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Why was the USS Liberty Attacked?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now my original question, may appear to be too broad; however I think there were specific difficulties in the US Israeli relations preceding the event which could be presented as a reasonable response;  Which I would like to attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Wording:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Using The USS Liberty attack, June 8th, 1967 as a fulcrum or pivot what historical events had the most influence on relatively cool relations (as demonstrated using US Foreign Aid to Israel as a metric) prior to 1967, and exponentially improving relations after 1967?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also tried to change my question to better focus on the events leading up and following the attack rather than the attack itself which is well documented elsewhere.  Using the USS Liberty as a pivotal moment in time between cool relations and exponentially improving relations using US foreign aid as a metric.  There were several comments asking for me to make a new question out of that.  Two questions on my part.  (1) First off is this a more acceptable question?  (2) Why can't we open the existing question given as written the original question asked for reasons for the attack, and was not about the attack itself.  Both question dealt with events leading up to the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitations for Ideas:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Could this topic be a legitimate one for a question? Or Not?&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My contention is given how many senior people on the US side express doubt on the Israeli position and the age almost 55 years ago.  This is a legitimate history question.  Granted a controversial one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can I re-word my question to make it more legitimate?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps someone can make the case this is not a legitimate topic as it's not settled history, given the NSA is still releasing classified information on this event?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it is felt this topic is too controversial for this board? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank You for your time in reading my meta question and your consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27618" LastEditorUserId="27618" LastEditDate="2018-01-29T05:56:18.223" LastActivityDate="2018-01-30T23:54:45.833" Title="Question about a Closed Question" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="3" />

What follows are my own opinions, please ignore any diamond you might see attached to my name!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the original version of the question was probably actually on-topic, but should have been worded better. The series of edits that followed is probably what made people think that you were arguing for a conspiracy theory, and suggested the topic would be a better fit for skeptics:SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You ask how can it be considered &quot;conspiracy&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your thesis seems to be that the United States conspired with the Israeli government to cover up a deliberate attack on a US Navy vessel by the IDF. Further, your quotes are all sourced from a site that also argues the existence of a conspiracy and cover-up. If that is your thesis, then the question probably does belong on the Skeptics site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this instance, it's not a question of whether you locate the original quotes, it's a question of whether those quotes have been chosen selectively for that site, and whether they were taken within context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also not a question of the positions that these people had formerly occupied. The question should be 'Do these people have any direct knowledge of the events in question&quot;. The statement:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel the Israelis knew what they were doing. They knew they were shooting at a U.S. Navy ship&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;means nothing. It isn't evidence one way or the other. What someone &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; might have happened isn't evidence. Their former position is irrelevant unless it gave them access to specific information about the incident. Including comments like this in your question does make it look more like an argument for a conspiracy theory, and less like a history question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, only three of your sources cited any information to support the claim that the attack was deliberate. Former US Ambassador to Lebanon Dwight Porter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It's an American ship!&quot; the pilot of an Israeli Mirage fighter-bomber radioed Tel Aviv as he sighted the USS Liberty on June 8, 1967. Israeli headquarters ordered the pilot to attack the American ship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant General William E. Odom, former director, National Security Agency:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;On the strength of intercept transcripts of pilots' conversations during the attack, the question of the attack's deliberateness &quot;just wasn't a disputed issue&quot; within the agency.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and Oliver Kirby, former deputy director for operations/production, National Security Agency:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I can tell you for an absolute certainty (from intercepted communications) that they knew they were attacking an American ship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that all three cite the same source - intercepted radio communication from the IDF pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when researching for my answer, it did not take me long to find a report in the Wall Street Journal of a 2001 letter from former Navy Chief Petty Officer Marvin Nowicki. He had been the chief Hebrew-language analyst aboard a U.S. Navy EC-121 spy plane that was intercepting Israeli aircraft communications during the attack on the USS Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He stated that he did indeed hear (and record) Israeli pilots’ and captains’ references to the U.S. flag flying on the deck of the Liberty, but that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;these remarks were made only after the attack was underway, and not before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Shockingly, that particular story does not appear to be quoted on the site you referenced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might very well think that is because it undermines their claim of a conspiracy. I, however, couldn't possibly comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I can't speak for anyone else, but as an historical researcher I would always give far more weight to the testimony of an eyewitness than to that of someone who later saw a report about an incident - regardless of their respective ranks. The only reason an historian would ignore that evidence would be because it didn't support the conclusion they were trying to reach. And that is bad practice (not just in the study of history)!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The edit timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I said right at the start, I'm not one of the people who voted to close the question. However, looking at the timeline of edits I can see that the question was only closed after you'd gone through a series of edits to incorporate quotes taken from a site which, as I explained above, is attempting to prove a conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would not be surprised if that was a factor in at least some cases for deciding that the question was off-topic for this site. It may also be a factor in the impressive number of downvotes that the question has attracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, could the original question have been written in a way that was on-topic for this site?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think so. I'd suggest that the structure of a valid question could be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A (very brief) description of the incident, with a link to a site&#xA;for people who want to find out more. Try to find an unbiased site,&#xA;or perhaps just Wikipedia.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mention the declassified report from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/uss-liberty/assets/files/dia-messages/israeli-court-inquiry.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Israeli Court of&#xA;Enquiry&lt;/a&gt;. Now, if you are going to quote from the report, quote&#xA;the text exactly as written. Do not attempt to improve their&#xA;spelling or grammar, and do not paraphrase, as you have done in the&#xA;question here. Also, &lt;strong&gt;be very careful to avoid the appearance of&#xA;quoting selectively from the text&lt;/strong&gt;. In the excerpt you've included&#xA;here, for example, you chose to omit the evidence that 2 IDF&#xA;officers on 2 different vessels apparently independently identified&#xA;the ship as Egyptian. Whether or not that evidence was true,&#xA;omitting it from your question, while including the later section&#xA;from the bottom of page 5, creates the impression of bias. Generally, I &#xA;would suggest that it is better in cases like this just to quote the &#xA;conclusions, and let people read the whole document for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;State that many survivors have never accepted the findings of the&#xA;Israeli Court of Enquiry. State that their opinion seems to be&#xA;shared by a number of former high ranking US officials. Provide a&#xA;link to your site (as you did in the original version of the&#xA;question) to support these assertions. Feel free to mention a few names, but &#xA;there is no need to quote every one of them (or, indeed any of them) in your &#xA;question. People can click the link and read for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Point out that the NSA has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/search/?q=uss%20liberty&amp;amp;sort=date&amp;amp;media=document&amp;amp;section=declass&amp;amp;page=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;released hundreds of declassified documents&lt;/a&gt; &#xA;since 1967, some of which directly relate to the incident.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, ask whether there is any &lt;strong&gt;evidence&lt;/strong&gt; amongst all the&#xA;material declassified since 1967 to contradict the official version&#xA;of events - i.e. that the attack was a mistake, resulting from poor&#xA;communication between units of the IDF and the mis-identification of&#xA;the vessel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that is just my opinion&lt;/strong&gt;. Others may take a different view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing questions with existing answers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would also suggest that it is also worth bearing in mind that in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3598/24858&quot;&gt;another question&lt;/a&gt; here on meta, people expressed strong views about questions being edited in a way that then invalidates existing answers (I can't say for certain, but that may explain some of the downvotes you've received in this case).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that, I would suggest that in those circumstances it is worth asking a new question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Your Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have asked 2 questions (apart from your &quot;Solicitations for Ideas&quot;). I shall try to answer the second question first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You new question, or &quot;second wording&quot; as you refer to it, is actually a very different question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;... what historical events had the most influence on relatively cool relations prior to 1967, and exponentially improving relations after 1967?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;bears almost no relation to the original question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why did the Israeli Defense Force attack the USS Liberty on June 8, 1967 killing 32 American Sailors, wounding 171, and doing so much damage to the ship that it ultimately had to be scrapped.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, given the views expressed in the answers to the question I mentioned above, about questions being edited in a way that then invalidates existing answers, I suspect that we have the answer to your second question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why can't we open the existing question given as written the original question asked for reasons for the attack, and was not about the attack itself. Both question dealt with events leading up to the attack?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because it is not the same question&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should have asked a new question, rather than editing the original. Never mind the merits, or otherwise, of the new question, if people think that you should not have edited the question in the first place they probably won't vote to re-open.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I may be wrong. The answer may just be 42. (It's a messed-up Universe!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, as to your first question, you asked whether the new question is more acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see several problems with the new question as it stands. The most obvious of which are implicit assumption that US foreign aid to Israel was only contingent on events in the region and that you are quoting average figures over long periods of time which do not appear to reflect the detail in the table on the site from which you are quoting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the new question, you also appear to be claiming that the attack on the USS Liberty had a particular significance for US/Israeli relations without providing any clear evidence to support that assertion. Put simply, &lt;em&gt;why would the USS Liberty attack on 8 June 8 1967 act as a fulcrum or pivot&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; supporting evidence, this would risk being classified as just another instance of the (all too common) logical fallacy, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;post hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Just because something occurs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; an event does not imply that it happened &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of that event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, you would need to add that supporting evidence to the question, or we are likely to be back to the conspiracy theory arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, 1967 was also in the middle of a pivotal period in the Vietnam War and the build up of US forces there under President Johnson. Not to mention the small matter of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tet Offensive&lt;/a&gt; in Vietnam in early 1968. Now, I don't lay claim to any particular inside knowledge, but it seems to me - in the absence of any new evidence - just as likely that the global situation, particularly in regard to the escalation in Vietnam, might have been the trigger for increased funding for America's main ally in the Middle East through the 1970s, and that the attack on the USS Liberty wasn't a factor at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why do you think that the attack on the USS Liberty changed US foreign policy in 1967/68? What evidence are you offering in support of that position? Are there declassified papers that suggest that this was the case? Non-trivial assertions that are not supported by evidence are &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/618/24858&quot;&gt;rarely well received&lt;/a&gt; on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what you have written, it seems that you have a particular answer that you believe to be correct. If that is indeed the case, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer&quot;&gt;post a new question and answer it yourself&lt;/a&gt;, but remember that the normal rules and guidance about asking and answering questions will still apply. It still needs to be on-topic for this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Moderators&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you have asked about moderator concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point I'll put my moderator hat back on, but please bear in mind that I'm still just speaking for myself. Other moderators may interpret the guidance differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think you misunderstand the role of moderators on Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am trying to exercise a &quot;light-touch&quot;, in accordance with my reading of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;Theory of Moderation&lt;/a&gt;, which explains that we are &quot;human exception-handlers&quot;. Interpret that as you will!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a moderator I can close or re-open questions with a single vote. However, just because I can doesn't mean that I should.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've argued here on meta in the past that some questions have been closed when they shouldn't have been. I now have the power to re-open them. I haven't done so because I think that would be an abuse of that power. (In fact, now I can't even nominate them to be re-opened and let the community decide. As a moderator, if I vote to re-open, the question is just re-opened&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Except in particularly egregious cases (Nazi spammers, posts that are just 'vandalism', etc.), I prefer to let the community vote. If I do vote to close or re-open, the it will normally only be as the fifth (or, at a push, the fourth) vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If posts are flagged for moderator attention by members of the community then I, or one of my fellow moderators, will review the flag and decide accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What that means in the context of your question is that I will not normally override a decision to close a post by members of the community&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a post that was closed by the community re-opened, you will need to convince the community that it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be re-opened. (If the post was closed by a moderator then there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/help/reopen-questions&quot;&gt;procedure&lt;/a&gt; available to you if you want us to reconsider the decision).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24858" LastEditorUserId="24858" LastEditDate="2018-01-30T23:54:45.833" LastActivityDate="2018-01-30T23:54:45.833" CommentCount="4" />
  <row Id="3660" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="3657" CreationDate="2018-01-30T00:22:32.070" Score="-2" Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Your thesis seems to be that the United States conspired with the Israeli government to cover up a deliberate attack on a US Navy vessel by the IDF. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just so we are clear between us, nothing like that was in my question.&#xA;My thesis if I were to construct one now would have to reference one of my two questions?  Or at least something I actually did write.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A conspiracy by the United States government would imply malicious or harmful intent of a cover up.  I never even alluded to such a thing. US actions can be explained without any malicious intent, just by reviewing historical events. &#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sempaiscuba:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  It is also not a question of the positions that these people had formerly occupied. The question should be 'Do these people have any direct knowledge of the events in question&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;I feel the Israelis knew what they were doing. They knew they were shooting at a U.S. Navy ship&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;means nothing. It isn't evidence one way or the other&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That quote is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ifamericaknew.org/us_ints/ul-boston.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Captain Ward Boston&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Advocate General Council for the US Navy.  He was Senior legal counsel for the Navy’s Court of Inquiry into the attack.  Clearly he was in a position to hear the complete proceedings as well be aware of all of the evidence still classified about the incident.  His opinion should have meaning.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sempaiscuba:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  In fact, only three of your sources cited any information to support the claim that the attack was deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never said the attack was deliberate.  All I was out to prove with my quotes was that their is doubt on the American side of the Israeli explanation.  Which is all I had to prove to have my question regarded as a history question rather than a conspiracy question.  That was my intent on introducing the quotes which otherwise don't relate to my question.  As I said in my above quote all the quotes express doubt about the Israeli position.  I'll give you Johnson and the Israelis I added in later because someone asked me too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@sempaiscuba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  So, could the original question have been written in a way that was on-topic for this site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I think so. I'd suggest that the structure of a valid question could be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All good advice, including the part about editing questions with existing answers, which I was not aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@sempaiscuba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Your new question, or &quot;second wording&quot; as you refer to it, is actually a very different question.  bears almost no relation to the original question: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first question, &quot;why the attack&quot;.  My second question &quot;historical events had the most influence on relatively cool relations&quot; to me is the same questions.  I can see how you would not think of them that way.   I was always trying to get at plausible reasons for the attack.  But I see your point.  To you they are entirely different questions because you would answer them differently than I.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To my mind both questions are answered with reference to the same events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fire Bombing the US Consulate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attempted fire bombing the US Embassy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Leading an UN Arms embargo against Israel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Threatening Israel's private donations from the US.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Forcing Israel out of the Sinai in 57, the buffer between their largest existential threat, and the objective of the six day war.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@sempaiscuba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Now, as to your first question,&#xA;  In the new question, you also appear to be claiming that the attack on the USS Liberty had a particular significance for US/Israeli relations without providing any clear evidence to support that assertion. Put simply, why would the USS Liberty attack on 8 June 8 1967 act as a fulcrum or pivot?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In truth,  given annual US aid to Israel jumped two orders of magnitude in the decade following the attack, or 5 times in the following year(68), I am not claiming it.  I am observing it.  The attack was a pivotal moment in the two countries relation.  Perhaps I should have used pivotal instead of fulcrum.  If I went into the details of explaining why, wouldn't I be answering my own question?  Maybe I should have done that.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@sempaiscuba&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  The most obvious of which are implicit assumption that US foreign aid to Israel was only contingent on events in the region and that you are quoting average figures over long periods of time which do not appear to reflect the detail in the table on the site from which you are quoting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually I think I was asserting the opposite.   That US aid to Israel increased by a factor of 5 from 67 when the attack took place to 1968, demonstrates the United States aid was not contingent on Israel's attack.  Your thought on the cold war is what I would go with also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;@SEMPAISCUBA,  Thank you again for a very informative discussion on board workings.  My take away is perhaps this could be a forum to discuss such topics, but not by me.  A relatively new member still trying to prove his chops.  Perhaps you or one of the other elite vanguard would be more successful.  Anyway I will keep swinging and try to show my worth.

But it can be like that also on matured sites where in certain subgroups of users a special in-group herd mentality is guiding many actions that do not really match the available documentation. Way too often one reads that &quot;SE is degenerating&quot; or &quot;a toxic environment&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;being a regular on a many SE sites is often an endless tiring stream of bad questions.

I would hope, also, that the SE powers that be would note that many questions here have one or two really good answers, and that any additional answers are unlikely to be more than repetition, spam or relevant 'scraps' which are better filed under 'comments' than 'answers'.

Among the possible solutions to this might be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be more supportive of new users' questions. Much has been said on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3669/dealing-with-newbie-questions-again&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; and although I think we definitely need to do this, we don't want the site flooded with sub-standard, poorly researched questions either.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ask more questions ourselves. Although we do need new members to keep the site alive and 'fresh', old members should be much better equipped to ask 'quality' questions. That said, the best questions tend to stem from a genuine desire to know something rather than trying to 'force it'...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Upvote questions more. No, I'm not recommending bribery (see below 'On the last point...). Nor am I suggesting an indiscriminate upvote on anything that doesn't deserve to be closed, but there is a clear imbalance between the number of upvotes on questions and upvotes on answers (not to mention that answers get 10 and questions only 5). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this last point, reputation is particularly important for newbies: it's needed to the get privileges which allow them to participate more actively on the site in the long-term (which will make it more likely that they'll stay). However, asking questions doesn't seem to be nearly as good a way to get reputation as riding on the coat tails of popular questions by giving short answers which (due to the sheer number of views) have a good chance of picking up 2 or 3 votes (4 to 6 upvotes on a question) even though they don't really add anything that hasn't already been said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The A - 10 / Q - 5 vote policy applies to all sites, and I've no reason to doubt that for most SE sites its a good policy. On History, though, I beg to differ: &lt;strong&gt;a good question can easily take longer to research and formulate than a good answer&lt;/strong&gt;, especially if you are not already well-informed on the general area of the question.

However, what I believe I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say is we have always been on a steady (if bumpy) upslope on QPD which, if projected into the future, puts our average over 10 (eyeballing it here) in roughly 3 or 4 years. That's of course assuming growth remains like it has been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a user you can perform a quick check of this yourself, by going to the main page and clicking on &quot;Questions&quot; and then &quot;Newest&quot;. Just count up how many you see for each day. As of this writing, the last three days are 8, 9, and 9, but that's likely just a blip. The last few times I've done this check the 3 day average has been a smidge over 7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know &quot;3 years&quot; sounds like a lot, but I've been tracking this since nearly inception, and for me we are getting tantalizingly close. When I started as a moderator we were getting roughly 4.5 QPD.

Sites that get closed are ones that are incapable of keeping themselves clean of garbage posts, or where no questions are getting answered. We are worlds past that kind of poor state. So as long as we don't drastically regress, and SE can afford to keep the servers powered, we have a home here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CODA: Well, let's all just post tons of questions then!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think you can do that, and make them good answerable questions, and &lt;strong&gt;keep it up indefinitely&lt;/strong&gt;, go for it. But I honestly don't think the best way to get there is by trying to artificially pump up one stat. I'd rather see us get more users and more visitors, such that we get more than 10 questions a day with no special effort at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To that end, if you can promote this site, and treat new users reasonably when they venture to participate, that is probably better.

The other two answers leave out the &quot;deeper&quot; part; entirely. It is well researched and amply referenced. The other two are both ephemeral, largely theoretical, and include one link each with dubious relevance to the question or the answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Delivering a comprehensive answer on both parts of the question seems unwanted by some. One commentator criticised the question as better to rephrase it into the direction of not D-Day but &quot;right to the end of the war&quot;. The referenced answer even covered that, despite the OP not editing his question to react to this suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the referenced answer was criticised as following an agenda: &quot;It's a simple yes/no question. But no occasion can be missed to push one's own agenda about Germans&quot; – Is there an anti-German bias? From what the author wrote or from what he quotes?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then it was deemed at &quot;denouncing&quot; policies of two states. What is &quot;denouncing&quot; in describing these policies; with agreeing references from reputable sources?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An explicit offer to edit the question was taken up on and primarily concerned with removing referenced evidence for – yes, some calls them as such – scandals  quite central to the &quot;deeper&quot; part of answering the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it might have been less than ideal how the author handled the translation of bureaucratic German into readable English at first. That was attempted to be addressed with increased precision, yet the quibbles that followed about &lt;em&gt;Ersatzzeit&lt;/em&gt; were no longer about accuracy for the occasion but making a stance that might be appropriate for a meta-discussion about a dictionary – but &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; not applicable to the quote in question and especially not if related back to the actual question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally the characterisation of the goals and circumstances when introducing the long standing German pension system was criticised: &quot;dismisses the whole pension system&quot;. It might indeed be read as dismissing, but it was just a paraphrasing summary from &lt;em&gt;the words of the inventor of that system&lt;/em&gt; and reinforced by citing researchers on that topic who – in the author's understanding at least – support the cynical interpretation of the whole construction. Loving the current pension system and its history so much that the thoughts of the first chancellor, and many that followed him, or researchers on that topic are perceived as so hurtful to justify dismissing this answer seems quite understandable in its illogical furor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To top it off, the author was personally criticised for taking a &quot;defensive posture in comments&quot; while trying to address justified criticism (which the first comment was certainly not), to explain inapplicable or unjustified criticism, and even explicitly inviting more &quot;criticise to improve comments&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The author fails to see any valid criticism left, towards the current shape of the answer, to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; answering the question, to use either offensive or opinionated language on his own. The author also fails to see that the sources might be questionable, the explanations, or the conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These observations leave largely two possible conclusions. Either there is still something validly described as content-wise 'wrong' with the answer. That would be quite nice to know. Or, the voting on this answer shows a certain irrational behaviour, perhaps even an agenda on its own. If it is the latter, it would be beneficial to hear some opinions on how this pure popularity voting effect might be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than resorting to popular banalities that are prime time TV compatible, currently it seems that &quot;don't mention the war&quot; is the best way around these controversial issues around and about &quot;Germany&quot;.

At the very least, many readers will be not upvote even if there is a lot of quality content. I think SJuan76 made this point very well. Readers want to make up their own minds without being told what is morally right or wrong (which will be blindingly obvious to most in this case, and those who disagree will quite likely downvote).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Spending too much time and space on not answering the main question is likely to either make readers move on to something else (especially if the answer is lengthy) or to downvote, perhaps because they feel their time has been wasted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lengthy answers and excerpts are also likely to make people move on to something else, usually without voting one way or the other.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don't think edits usually repair all the 'damage' done by what is seen as a 'bad' answer for the simple reason that a lot of people don't re-visit answers they've already voted on.

These are not essential details, but simply background information to help those unfamiliar with the &lt;em&gt;dramatis personae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also generally happy to provide links to Wikipedia for uncontentious topics, although with a note of caution that you didn't mention. While the URL to the Wikipedia page shouldn't change, the content of that page might. Almost anyone can edit Wikipedia - it is, in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;... written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might link to a page with content that is uncontentious, and which provides the mainstream view about a topic, a future edit may change that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for things like the British Expeditionary Force, and the background to the Dunkirk evacuation itself which I also mentioned in my answer above the Wikipedia pages again provide useful background for those less-familiar with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, for the documents that provide the main sources for my answer (the diaries of General Halder, the note from Major-General Alfred Jodl to labour minister Robert Ley, etc.) I prefer to link to online, digitised versions of the original documents where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, Wikipedia is getting better at providing sources for its content, but it is a slow process (see the reviews in the academic journals listed above). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wikipedia is still no substitute for proper peer-reviewed sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of the journals containing those sources are now only available online behind a paywall. I was challenged about this when I provided links to this type of site in some of my early answers (I pay for access to the relevant sites because I need them for research).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That actually seems to me to be a reasonable complaint. The point of linking to the source is to support the assertions we make in our questions and answers. If others can't read those sources, then how do they know we are quoting them correctly? How can they follow up on the answer and take their research further? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also clearly going to be extremely frustrating to have to search for alternatives (as you may have now experienced yourself in the case of the journal articles I cited above)!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On other questions, I have used books from my own 'library' as the source for my answer. I'm lucky in that regard. I own quite a lot of books. Unfortunately, while books are wonderful things, they can be difficult to share online. Often, those books are also available on Google Books, but Sods-Law dictates that the preview doesn't include the relevant pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have often spent longer looking for decent online sources to support the points in my answer than I spent on writing the answer itself. [If anyone is interested, I've found archive.org to be a very useful resource in that regard. In particular, they have a complete series of the Congressional Record which is obviously &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; go-to source for a lot of American political history].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, yes, in the final analysis, and given all the caveats mentioned above, sometimes it is just easier to quote Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the article there is well written (many articles are, despite the criticisms people often make), and if the [current] content appears to be correct, then I'm reasonable happy to include it as a link in my answer. I would argue that is generally better than providing no supporting source at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least then others can review my source, and challenge it if they feel that it it wrong (hopefully they would also provide alternative sources to support their position). And surely that is, in fact, the main reason for providing supporting sources in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24858" LastActivityDate="2018-03-08T02:09:51.807" CommentCount="1" />

If you want to backup your claim about perhaps well-known facts that are non-central to your argument, then higher standard historical sources might not be the easiest to accomplish what you want to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Peripheral sources I would like to call them should be fine to illustrate, to give context to weigh the arguments. Central claims need reliable sources central to the field of discussion. One might contrast yellow press articles with what books or research articles have to say about a certain topic.

I sincerely appreciate the open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish that I had found an easier way to quote/reference only the last sentence of my answer - what I wanted to emphasize was the importance of phrasing things so that the value of learning overwhelmed the probability of offense. Everything else was contextual so that that statement didn't float in a void.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how to clearly articulate the following, other than to say that I think the question falls into a region where there are multiple legitimate opinions.  I want to be clear that I think the opinions you express in the question are valid - I'm not arguing that you're wrong.  (In my opinion, half the flamewars on the internet are driven by a failure to distinguish between &quot;I&quot;m right you're wrong&quot; and &quot;I don't see it that way....&quot; - this falls solidly in the latter group).  I guess what I'm trying to make very explicit here is that I'm trying to discuss the question, not to discuss you.  I hope that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the original title was objectively hurtful - reading that title without the question would legitimately propagate the ethnic slur in question. I proposed an edit, and you thanked me for it - I think this moved the question closer to the center.  (I mention this because I think it supports that we both approached this as mature, reasonable people).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see your point about objective discussion, but I can't agree with it.  In my opinion, ethnic slurs don't occur in an objective realm; they are primarily and fundamentally an emotional issue.  I suspect, although I can't prove, that they are chosen to be more effective at manipulating emotions than in persuading the mind.  Discussion of ethnic slurs can reasonably be expected to be harmful unless they meet an extraordinarily high standard.  The history of the stereotype renders it into a symbol in and of itself. That's why we recognize certain words as hate speech; their emotional value dominates their objective value.  I think it is prudent to err on the side of caution This is not clearly stated in the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice&quot;&gt;be nice&lt;/a&gt;&quot; policy, but I believe it is implied.  (I really don't like using implied policy, but in this case I choose to let the implied policy guide my behavior.)  There is an element of &quot;When did you stop beating your wife?&quot;. The Ethnicity is forced into the position of defending against an accusation that has no validity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question perpetrates the stereotype without any serious evidence of the actual behavior, nor does it answer whether the behavior is more prevalent among the ethnic group in question than in other ethnic groups or the general populace.  (not your intent, but these are some of the high standards that I would apply to this type of questions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the behavior in question is not value neutral.  If we were discussing whether they ate the large end of the egg or the small end of the egg first, I would be inclined to agree that objective discussion would be useful.  The behavior in question is one that most cultures condemn; consequently discussing it associates that behavior with that ethnic group.  I believe when the association between the ethnic group and the behavior is proven to be false, the association remains (I'm actually pretty sure of this, but I don't have the evidence/citations to hand, so I'm just going to assert it as an opinion).  I wish that you were right and that objective discussion would change opinions.  On issues of prejudice I don't see any evidence that objective discussion of stereotyped behavior changes opinions/values/attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to apply an empathy standard as well as an objectivity standard.   You've phrased your question as responsibly as you can, but I have to ask myself whether&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If my Muslim friends read this, would they be hurt?

Guess what? They're not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comments are, first and foremost, ephemeral. They're inherently impermanent. If you post a comment, don't expect it to stick around for long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're told this when you first gain the privilege to leave comments, at 50 reputation. You get a nice notification &quot;congrats, you've earned this privilege.

Not permanent notes on an answer. Just an ephemeral note... that has a very specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the Post-It note analogy ends. While Post-It notes can be used for a whole multitude of things, comments are really intended for three very specific purposes, again enumerated in the help center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h1&gt;When should I comment?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You should submit a comment if you want to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Request &lt;strong&gt;clarification&lt;/strong&gt; from the author;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Leave &lt;strong&gt;constructive criticism&lt;/strong&gt; that guides the author in improving the post;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Add relevant but &lt;strong&gt;minor or transient information&lt;/strong&gt; to a post (e.g. a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three very specific purposes... which happen to not include answering the question. In fact, in the next section, &quot;When shouldn't I comment?&quot;, we see mention of answering the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h1&gt;When &lt;em&gt;shouldn't&lt;/em&gt; I comment?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering a question&lt;/strong&gt; or providing an alternate solution to an existing answer; instead, post an actual answer (or edit to expand an existing one);&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we wanted people to write answers in comments like that, answers wouldn't exist. Not to mention that writing answers in comments has some serious drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Comments cannot be downvoted, only upvoted, and so you can't have the quality checks that answers have. You cannot edit comments to improve them after 5 minutes. You cannot accept a comment. If you answer in a comment, and the OP says that solved their problem, they may leave the site never to return and leave an answer unaccepted, if the commenter answered with what they had originally posted as a comment.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;sub&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://interpersonal.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1644/31&quot;&gt;Interpersonal Skills meta&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that you can't get rep from comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And you're &lt;em&gt;reminded&lt;/em&gt; of this &lt;em&gt;every time you go to write a comment&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fnZez.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fnZez.png&quot; alt=&quot;Avoid answering questions in comments.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now we've determined that writing answers in the comments is a bad idea, not worth it, and directly against site guidelines. So now, despite this, someone didn't feel like writing a full answer and dumped their half-written answer into a convenient textbox that was never intended for anything like that to be put in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now someone comes along, sees the comments, and thinks &quot;Hey, that could be a good answer if I take that information, flesh it out, and source it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go for it.

If you acknowledge that the source is unconfirmed, then only a jerk will downvote.  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Dr X in his paper Y says that baryons are responsible for most economic activity in left handed people.  If this were true, it would answer the question, but nobody has been able to provide a model or experimental evidence.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&quot;Professor Z argued that the American Revolution was caused by socioeconomic stresses; Profession &lt;strong&gt;Bailyn&lt;/strong&gt;'s analysis of pamphlet's undermined this, and Professor Z's views are now in doubt....&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second caveat - hat tip to @langlangC - history is a dialogue, and differentiating between mainstream, alternative and fringe theories is not a simple matter.  I think that @LangLangC provides the best guidance - &quot;Using only fringe and then declare that as 'the one truth there is/wake up' is entirely different.&quot;  I'd summarize that if you acknowledge the dialogue, then downvotes are jerks, but if you assert that your truth is the only truth, then downvotes are likely, and quite probably legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I think it should be permitted to politely point out that an answer is based on sources that are not generally accepted, or that are otherwise controversial.

Where to draw it can arguably be debated to death. Personally, I'd usually draw it at when a generation or two has come to age after the event and its short-term ramifications have all played out to their conclusions. Put another way, an event becomes history when it no longer is a vivid part of a new generation's collective memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point in drawing this line is to give enough time for the dust to settle. Information presented as facts at the time of an event may turn out to be false or incomplete; there can be good calls and misjudgments on the likely effects and legacy of an event; etc. When there are enough adults in the street who weren't born when an event and its short-term ramifications were in full motion, methinks everyone can agree the event is history; before that, it's still a current event in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This definition, as an aside, makes where to draw the line very fuzzy depending on the event and its significance. Indeed, some events can stay current for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that 9/11, for instance, is still a current event to a large degree in the sense that what its immediate aftereffects (the war on terror, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, etc.) arguably are still in full motion. I can still vividly remember the before and the after 9/11; methinks it'll take another generation or two before we can all agree it should be filed under history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I'd put forward that the GD and WW2 stayed current events for a very long time - possibly over two generations. As an anecdote, my parents grew up into adults that carried over - albeit to a much lesser degree - the obsessions of their own parents with having little to no debt in case of job loss, a garden in case of food shortages, and a chimney in case of fuel shortages. Both were born a few years &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; WW2, but the scars of the latter took a while to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we can agree that the crowd giggle during the Royal Wedding is someone cracking a joke at one point with the joke not getting picked up by any microphones. We might learn what the joke was in a few weeks or months or years - assuming ever - when someone who actually witnessed the event discusses it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your Sephardic peoples question, the laws were passed only a few years ago - which in government time is just about yesterday. Government sites might have some raw numbers, hence my suggestion to ask in Politics. But for the rest, I'm fairly certain we'll need a generation or two to get enough witness accounts of how things went before anyone is able to unequivocally say proof of descent was easier or harder than jumping through administrative hoops.

Information like chronologies and measurements are in the historical record immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, some records become available immediately. Others take longer. In the example of the Royal wedding, the video was live, and so part of the record was indeed immediate. However, here in the UK we are still being bombarded with adverts for &quot;&lt;em&gt;the special souvenir issue&lt;/em&gt;&quot; of this or that magazine, and stories about the event are still appearing as &quot;&lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;&quot; items in broadcast and print media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it takes time for the historical record to become established.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the one hand we have the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-42487425&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;fake news&lt;/a&gt;&quot; stories that proliferate on social media. An example of this was the claim that the death-toll in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;fire at Grenfell Tower&lt;/a&gt; in June 1017 was actually in the hundreds and that the authorities were covering this up. We now know that 81 people died in the fire. However, it was almost 3 weeks after the fire before the police and fire service were able to give a definitive figure. The public enquiry into the fire has just started, 11 months later.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the other, we have genuine human error, when facts are reported in error. This latter category is not something new. A famous example being the Chicago Daily Tribune headline &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dewey Defeats Truman&lt;/a&gt; in November 1948.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These types of story both form part of the historical record, but it can take time before they are recognised for what they are and we understand where they should fit within the historical narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would say that the 1948 US Presidential election definitely counts as history. The Grenfell Tower fire is still a current event, and the ongoing public enquiry means that it will probably remain a current event for some time to come - possibly years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the Royal wedding? Well, that certainly still &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a current event. At this moment, I think that the historical record is still being written, and so it may be too soon to apply historical methods in order answer questions about the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think there can be any rule about when events pass from the realm of '&lt;em&gt;current events&lt;/em&gt;' into the domain of '&lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt;'. It depends on the nature of the events. It may be weeks or months. It may be years.

I mention this only to exclude this class, because if the event is not trivial, then the following factors become more important.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion of current events generally takes place in the context of incomplete information.  Current events usually rely on the interpretation of a single source, and almost by definition there are active participants who want to suppress, shape or control that source.  If the event isn't trivial, then the meaning and significance of the event is under discussion by multiple parties. History is in the process of being written by the victors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion of current events generally has few secondary and no tertiary sources. There is no way to distinguish between &quot;current events&quot;, &quot;propaganda&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot;.  There is no analysis or interpretation of events, merely assertions by sources with agendas.  I started to include here an example of a story I remember being reported on a major news media outlet that turned out to be entirely fictitious; but if I provide the details, this will degenerate into a political discussion of those particular events.  What makes history interesting is analyzing the events of the past to better understand the present.  I believe that analyzing the events of the present to understand the present is a different activity (might be called journalism, might be called navel-gazing).   Mixing this with history diminishes the value of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actively reject the notion that everything that happened more than 1 attosecond ago is history; history is a narrative we construct. History is a verb; it is the process of understanding events.  If history were a simple recounting of events, then it would be impossible to have Marxist historians and Feminist historians and Whig historians - history would be objective, and clear (quite frankly, there would be no college level courses in history, and no degrees in history).  If history were just events, then it would be so boring as to not merit a stack exchange.  Asserting that anything that happened is history is tantamount to saying that math is just counting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have previously argued that if the answer is derived from historical sources and methods, then it is a history question, but if the answer is derived from rhetorical methods, it is current events.  An analysis of the any sequence events can be either historical, rhetorical or political depending on the tools used for analysis.  There is no bright line between the analysis; which is why the site is community moderated; we rely on consensus of the participants.  I'd argue that we should continue to do so.  If we find a specific question to be historical, then it is; if we find it to be current events, then for the purposes of this SE, it is.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastEditorUserId="1401" LastEditDate="2018-05-31T11:25:49.413" LastActivityDate="2018-05-31T11:25:49.413" CommentCount="1" />

Transforming genocide into a verb reduces it to something simple and banal, which removes the horror.  Stalin was wrong; the difference between murder and genocide is not the difference between a tragedy and a statistic, and confusing the two will not lead to learning or understanding.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Genocide is a crime - crimes require intent and action.

It seems they were replaced with immediate upvotes. Securing those questions a spot on the Hot Network Question (HNQ) list. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HNQs can have quite pleasant effects: reputation for the posters, exposure for the site on the network etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this has also effects that seem concerning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site gets outside exposure on the network primarily with low quality questions, which attract often quite a bunch of votes, newbie answers of comparable quality lacking sources and so on.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;While HNQs are primarily about popularity of the topic, not about the quality of the posts, and the results predictable, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; place those posts on that list. Before there is time to improve the post (that is: &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the original poster improves the question along the lines we should desire) a huge bandwagon of voters has already stampeded over the whole thread – distorting the StackExchange voting model and this site's standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why? Why are there so widely differing standards on posts sometimes requesting prior research and requesting sources in questions or answers? Shouldn't we aim at a little more consistency on desirable quality standards?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb I would say that if a question is low quality, like &quot;does not show prior research effort&quot; we should seriously restrain us from upvoting too quickly. Assuming that as the main reason for HNQ placement.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As a second rule of thumb I would say that if an answer has &quot;no sources&quot; a &quot;sources would improve this answer&quot; &lt;em&gt;banner&lt;/em&gt; should always be added.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As a third rule of thumb I suppose that an answer that is judged as &quot;good enough as to not needing sources&quot; then the question falls automatically into the category of &quot;too basic&quot; and should be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the hotness algorithm is not fully published and different for different sites (depending on its size on the network) and different for the sidebar and the hot notwork page.

The situation gets worse if there are multiple answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions to draw from that seem difficult.

At the very least, not giving explanation must be incompatible with the idea that holds are first and foremost meant to give a user time to correct their question rather than to shut it down, a really laudable point I saw you express in a comment recently. In short, if some users cant help but make @$$#$ of themselves, surely the answer is to disengage with, show zero-tolerance to, or pile close votes onto them, rather than effectively punish all users, esp. new ones? The latter also gives cover to users with voting privileges to (perhaps) start using them a bit more whimsically, and (perhaps) a lot more often than they might if all felt more accountable to debate and site rules.

Let me reiterate some of the key points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Votes on H:SE are inherently valid.  My vote based on telepathic advice from my pet goldfish is just as valid as @ExampleUser's vote based on his PhD thesis on the subject in question.  That is what community moderation means.  (we could discuss the law of large numbers, and statistical significance, but the ground rules wouldn't change).  If you accept the SE model, you accept the possibility that the community will moderate without explanation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Votes are feedback, but they're not very granular; explanations are granular.  Consequently if we want posters to have feedback, we want to encourage votes coupled with feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;History [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] proves that if I explain my vote, OP will respond that I am wrong, stupid and morally bankrupt, and then go on a rant about my personal hygiene.  This is another feedback cycle, and most of us have learned that the only way to avoid having complete strangers give detailed criticisms of our personality and grooming habits is to remain silent; to provide no feedback and no explanation for the close vote. (or the downvote).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;@Era is still optimistic enough to believe that we as a community could disincentivize the personal abuse.  Is that credible? Should I man up and put on my big boy panties and accept the slings and arrows of unruly fate, or should we as a community take arms against against a Sea of troubles And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep  No more.  I fear that if we take arms, we will sleep no more - the struggle will be eternal.

I'm not saying the examples here are exhaustive, but they should help clarify the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it is not at all clear from your answer why you think that the date of printing the modern Bible has anything to do with the date that the Book of Ezekiel was written, or its historical veracity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is even less clear to me why you think the story of Noah and the flood has anything at all to do with this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the context, I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; that the point you are trying to make is simply that the Bible is, at best, an unreliable historical source. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that is the case, then I'd suggest that you simply say so and pick one of the many available &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; sources to cite and support your case.  If your point is supposed to be something different, then I'd suggest that this part of your answer probably needs to be re-written with clear and reliable sources that support the point you are trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We then come to some rather more specific and problematic cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your claim that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Ancient Egyptian civilization is at least 25,000 years old, as reflected in the procession of the equinoxes encoded into the so-called &quot;Giza complex&quot;, where the Great Pyramid of Khufu still stands&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;is entirely unsupported by the sources that you cite. As far as I can see, not one of your 3 sources actually makes that claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[As an aside, I'd generally recommend that if you're going to cite multiple sources in that way, you should at least do your readers the courtesy of placing them on seperate lines, so that it is easy to see they are, actually, &lt;em&gt;seperate&lt;/em&gt; sources.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt#History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ancient Egyptian civilisation&lt;/a&gt; is generally accepted to have originated in the Neolithic with the Faiyum A culture in Lower Egypt (with evidence dating back to about 6000 BCE), and the Badari culture, which has given us the earliest evidence of agriculture and permanent settlement in Upper Egypt dating to around 5000 BCE.  These were followed by the more-familiar Naqada cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you wish to make the claim that &quot;&lt;em&gt;The Ancient Egyptian civilization is at least 25,000 years old&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, &lt;strong&gt;you are going to need to support that claim with some fairly solid evidence&lt;/strong&gt;. As it stands you have presented no such evidence. &lt;strong&gt;A citation of some sort (preferably something reliable) is therefore required for this assertion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You then state that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At some point western academia states that those original African people mated with the different species Neanderthal, and Denisovan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, you don't cite a source for this claim. Again, this is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm fully aware of the current debate about whether Neanderthals should be considered a sub-species of Homo Sapiens, &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;, or an entirely separate species, &lt;em&gt;Homo neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;.  I'm not at all sure that everyone who visits this site and reads your answer will also share that awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That debate is ongoing and as yet is not settled, so if you wish to make this claim then &lt;strong&gt;you are going to have to back it up with evidence&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[In fact, those who wish to argue that they are separate species face a problem in that, part of the definition of a species is that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;... organisms within a species produce fertile offspring&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since we now have DNA evidence that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; in fact produce fertile offspring (even if that turns out to have been limited to the female line), that means that they must have been the same species &lt;em&gt;by the current definition of the term &quot;species&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, it may well be that the definition of &lt;em&gt;species&lt;/em&gt; actually needs to be refined in the light of new evidence from sources like DNA. Eventually, it may come down to a simple matter of semantics, but in any event, the debate is ongoing.  What is clear is that the new evidence is revealing a more nuanced reality through the research efforts of &lt;em&gt;modern western academia and modern western science&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was under the impression that we had dealt with the claims that you make about DNA evidence and Ramesses III in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/a/47382/24858&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; to your previous question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, the article by David Sepuya Kalanzi does not accurately reflect the report by DNA Tribes.  What they actually said in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnatribes.com/dnatribes-digest-2013-02-01.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Digest, dated 1 February 2013&lt;/a&gt;, was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These results indicate that both Ramesses III and Unknown Man E (possibly his son Pentawer) shared an ancestral component with present day populations of Sub-Saharan Africa. This preliminary analysis based on eight STR markers does not identify the percentages of Sub-Saharan African ancestry for these ancient individuals. This preliminary analysis also does not exclude additional ancestral components (such as Near Eastern or Mediterranean related components) for these ancient pharaonic Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, these DNA match results in present day world regions might in part express population changes in Africa after the time of Ramesses III. In particular, DNA matches in present day populations of Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes might to some degree reflect genetic links with ancient populations (formerly living closer to New Kingdom Egypt) that have expanded southwards in the Nilotic and Bantu migrations of the past 3,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the post notice states, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Please edit to add citations to &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; sources that support the assertions made here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;my emphasis&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this context, the &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; used by a journalist will always be considered to be more reliable than any article they write.  Given my answer to your previous question, it might be considered disingenuous at best to cite the same (unreliable) source here in the same context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;latest DNA analysis&lt;/a&gt; that I'm aware of (involving 166 samples from 151 mummified individuals), which provides:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods and assessing the authenticity of the retrieved ancient DNA via characteristic nucleotide misincorporation patterns and statistical contamination tests to ensure the ancient origin of [the] data&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;found that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the ancient Egyptians actually most closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern and European populations, especially those in the Levant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this is entirely consistent with the claims made in the actual report from DNA Tribes, given the caveats I quoted above, but would seem to make a complete nonsense of the article that you have cited as your source.  Again, a &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; citation would be required to support your claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also some other less-glaring instances that, in my opinion, would benefit from additional (reliable) citations - more for the benefit of those less familiar with the subject than because the points are particularly contentious.  However, in my experience instances like these would not usually result in the answer being flagged by our users, and so receiving a post notice from a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this feedback helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps your question does raise one important point though. It is possible that the wording of the post notice should be made more clear.  Maybe the final sentence should read something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Unsourced material, &lt;em&gt;or assertions supported by only unreliable or dubious sources&lt;/em&gt;, may be disputed or deleted&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you think that would be an improvement?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24858" LastActivityDate="2018-08-05T01:37:38.933" CommentCount="1" />

David Sterling&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;of Abraham, Rebecca, Jacob, and Leah in Hebron originated as cult&#xA;  sites of Canaanite gods and goddesses&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Bible is not a historical document, period. The Bible, &lt;strong&gt;including all of its content&lt;/strong&gt; is completely historically worthless, &lt;strong&gt;without exception&lt;/strong&gt;. Reasoning: The story of Noah's Flood is completely inconsistent and irreconcilable with the actual historical record left by the African Ancient Egyptians. The Temple of Seti I at Abydos proves that the unbroken lines of &quot;kings&quot; of Ancient Egypt spans before, during and after the fable of the flood of Noah.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We then come to some rather more specific and problematic cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Your claim that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Ancient Egyptian civilization is at least 25,000 years old, as&#xA;    reflected in the procession of the equinoxes encoded into the&#xA;    so-called &quot;Giza complex&quot;, where the Great Pyramid of Khufu still&#xA;    stands&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;is entirely unsupported by the sources that you cite.

The same reasoning applies to procession of the equinoxes being encoded into the so-called &quot;Giza complex&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is, the only way for the African Ancient Egyptians to accurately or approximately calculate the procession of the equinoxes, or the Great Year, is the have actually have observed the entire cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since there has been confusion as to the reasoning for drawing the above conclusion, to avoid such confusion, attribute that portion of this answer to this user: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/users/28734/guest271314&quot;&gt;guest271314&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[As an aside, I'd generally recommend that if you're going to cite&#xA;  multiple sources in that way, you should at least do your readers the&#xA;  courtesy of placing them on seperate lines, so that it is easy to see&#xA;  they are, actually, seperate sources.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A comma or semi-colon suffices to separate sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In fact, the Ancient Egyptian civilisation is generally accepted to&#xA;  have originated in the Neolithic with the Faiyum A culture in Lower&#xA;  Egypt (with evidence dating back to about 6000 BCE), and the Badari&#xA;  culture, which has given us the earliest evidence of agriculture and&#xA;  permanent settlement in Upper Egypt dating to around 5000 BCE.

Western academias ideas are of not more or less value than the ideas of people who &lt;em&gt;refute&lt;/em&gt; western academic ideas - without waiting for those western academics to settle their internal debates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I was under the impression that we had dealt with the claims that you&#xA;  make about DNA evidence and Ramesses III in my answer to your previous&#xA;  question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In short, the article by David Sepuya Kalanzi does not accurately&#xA;  reflect the report by DNA Tribes. What they actually said in their&#xA;  Digest, dated 1 February 2013, was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These results indicate that both Ramesses III and Unknown Man E&#xA;  (possibly his son Pentawer) shared an ancestral component with present&#xA;  day populations of Sub-Saharan Africa. This preliminary analysis based&#xA;  on eight STR markers does not identify the percentages of Sub-Saharan&#xA;  African ancestry for these ancient individuals. This preliminary&#xA;  analysis also does not exclude additional ancestral components (such&#xA;  as Near Eastern or Mediterranean related components) for these ancient&#xA;  pharaonic Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, these DNA match results in present day world regions&#xA;  might in part express population changes in Africa after the time of&#xA;  Ramesses III. In particular, DNA matches in present day populations of&#xA;  Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes might to some degree&#xA;  reflect genetic links with ancient populations (formerly living closer&#xA;  to New Kingdom Egypt) that have expanded southwards in the Nilotic and&#xA;  Bantu migrations of the past 3,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No impression was given that the African Ancient Egyptians did not have their origin in sub-Saharan Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Geographical analysis of Ramesses III and Unknown Man E (possibly&#xA;  Ramesses’ son Pentawer) was performed using their autosomal STR&#xA;  profiles based on eight tested loci.9,10 Results are summarized in&#xA;  Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 2-3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Discussion: Results in Table 1 indicate that the autosomal STR&#xA;  profiles for both &lt;strong&gt;Ramesses&lt;/strong&gt; and Unknown Man E &lt;strong&gt;are most frequent&#xA;  in present day regions of Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/strong&gt; and also found in Near&#xA;  Eastern regions at lower frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Among present day world populations, Ramesses III’s autosomal STR profile is most frequent in the African Great Lakes region&lt;/strong&gt;, where it&#xA;  is approximately 335.1 times as frequent as in the world as a whole&#xA;  (see Table 1 and Figure 2). Unknown Man E’s autosomal STR profile is&#xA;  most frequent in the Southern Africa region, where it is approximately&#xA;  134.6 times as frequent as in the world as whole (see Table 1 and Figure 3). Both autosomal STR profiles are also found in the Levantine&#xA;  region that includes populations of present day Egypt, but are&#xA;  substantially more frequent in regions of Sub-Saharan Africa (see&#xA;  Table 1). Specifically, both of these ancient individuals inherited&#xA;  the alleles D21S11=35 and CSFIPO=7, which are found throughout&#xA;  Sub-Saharan Africa but are comparatively rare or absent in other&#xA;  regions of the world. These African related alleles are different from&#xA;  the African related alleles identified for the previously studied&#xA;  Amarna period mummies (D18S51=19 and D21S11=34).11 This provides&#xA;  independent evidence for African autosomal ancestry in two different&#xA;  pharaonic families of New Kingdom Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though Ramses DNA only reflects their DNA, not the actual origin of the Nile Valley &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now, the post notice states,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Please edit to add citations to reliable sources that support the&#xA;    assertions made here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;my emphasis In this context, the source used by a journalist will always be considered to be more reliable than any article they write.&#xA;  Given my answer to your previous question, it might be considered&#xA;  disingenuous at best to cite the same (unreliable) source here in the&#xA;  same context.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In fact, the latest DNA analysis that I'm aware of (involving 166&#xA;  samples from 151 mummified individuals), which provides:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&quot;the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using&#xA;    high-throughput DNA sequencing methods and assessing the authenticity&#xA;    of the retrieved ancient DNA via characteristic nucleotide&#xA;    misincorporation patterns and statistical contamination tests to&#xA;    ensure the ancient origin of [the] data&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;found that the ancient Egyptians actually most closely resembled&#xA;  ancient and modern Near Eastern and European populations, especially&#xA;  those in the Levant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now, this is entirely consistent with the claims made in the actual&#xA;  report from DNA Tribes, given the caveats I quoted above, but would&#xA;  seem to make a complete nonsense of the article that you have cited as&#xA;  your source. Again, a reliable citation would be required to support&#xA;  your claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; and deities of the African Ancient Egyptians reflect an sub-Saharan origin which spread &lt;em&gt;down north&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;from&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;up south&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;up south&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;down north&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is a scholarly disagreement as to the facts and &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; relevant to the DNA analysis, then so be it. The study of history is rife with disagreement and different interpretation of facts. No one is under the compulsion to accept &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of facts. Especially when your interpretation is being construed here as inherently biased towards a non-sub-Sarahan origin of the African Ancient Egyptians, or the view that people need to &quot;wait&quot; for some other group of people to &quot;settle&quot; their own disagreements; and to be direct, your analysis of the available data relevant to the subject matter is substantially incorrect and historically inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are also some other less-glaring instances that, in my opinion,&#xA;  would benefit from additional (reliable) citations - more for the&#xA;  benefit of those less familiar with the subject than because the&#xA;  points are particularly contentious. However, in my experience&#xA;  instances like these would not usually result in the answer being&#xA;  flagged by our users, and so receiving a post notice from a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I hope you find this feedback helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, your feedback is not helpful relevant to the defacing label you and the group of users and moderators who have decided to pursue your agenda of defacing users' posts with ridiculous defacing labels. Just stop doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps your question does raise one important point though. It is&#xA;  possible that the wording of the post notice should be made more&#xA;  clear. Maybe the final sentence should read something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Unsourced material, or assertions supported by only unreliable or&#xA;    dubious sources, may be disputed or deleted&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you think that would be an improvement?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The defacing label should be immediately removed from this users' answer and not be used at all in the future. An inherently flawed and horrible idea, as detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1560/the-time-machine&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be improved. The idea to deface users' answers with a so-called &quot;notice&quot; should be abandoned completely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="28734" LastActivityDate="2018-08-06T20:44:06.413" CommentCount="0" />
